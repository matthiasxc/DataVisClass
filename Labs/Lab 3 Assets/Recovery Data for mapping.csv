The key group of parties includes B&W and Air Liquide as sub-awardees. This advanced clean coal facility has been designated as the FutureGen 2.0 Oxy-Combustion Large Scale Test Project (the Project).  The primary objective is to design, construct and operate an oxy-combustion power generation facility which is fully integrated with the FutureGen 2.0 Pipeline and Regional CO2 Storage Reservoir Project. This oxy-combustion coal-fired test plant will: ? Be the first-of-a-kind commercial scale oxy-fired coal plant in the world  ? Exhibit the full integration of an innovative air separation unit and a CO2 compression and purification unit into a full scale utility application for electric power generation ? Repower an existing 200 megawatt plant with the oxy-combustion technology ? Validate the technical and financial feasibility of the use of the oxy-combustion technology for utility power plant applications  ? Be a Near Zero Emissions Plant (NZEP) ? Treat 100% of the flue gas and remove 90+% of the CO2 resulting in the capture of approximately 1.3 million tonnes (1.3MMT) per year of CO2 from the plant ? Show progress toward the overall CCS program goal of no more than a 35% percent increase in the cost of electricity ?

Located near the city of Hinkley in California's Mojave Desert, the 250 (net) megawatt (MW) project will operate on solar energy only, with no supplemental fossil fuel contribution.  The technology is based on the same parabolic trough system that has been proven over a period of nearly 25 years at the Solar Electric Generating Systems (“SEGS”) facilities located nearby at three locations in the Mojave Desert.  ASL will further enhance the proven performance of this technology through advancements in plant efficiency factors, O&M practices and the incorporation of new and significantly improved components and design.  The Project will be designed to produce clean, solar electricity by means of an integrated process using solar energy to heat a synthetic petroleum-based fluid in a closed-loop system that, in turn, heats water to create steam to drive a conventional steam turbine.  Upon completion in mid-2014, MSP is projected to generate more than 617,000 MWh (net) of solar-generated electricity each year, enough to provide for the annual energy needs of more than 88,000 California residential households while avoiding more than 435 kilotons of greenhouse gases that would otherwise contribute to global warming and climate change.  The Project will cover a surface area of approximately 1,750 acres on previously disturbed agricultural land and its construction will create thousands of jobs, including approximately 830 construction jobs on average over a 28-month construction period, and 70 full-time jobs once completed. The direct and indirect jobs created by the project will be located primarily in California and in neighboring states.  The construction of this project will also result in the construction of a new substation and a major transmission network upgrade that will eventually become part of the CAISO transmission system and benefit the residents of California and the surrounding states.",CA,US,Hinkley,35.015667,-117.330325,

It is the vision of the BCIN to strengthen a collaborative regional health care system built on health information technology that balances the needs of patients, providers, and payers; protects personal privacy; enables competition to advance health care services; and promotes secure sharing of health information to optimize health care and health outcomes. This vision will be accomplished through evolving and advancing an already robust regional HIT and health information exchange (HIE) infrastructure. The primary technical foundation for the BCIN will be an expanded HIE to increase information sharing between a wide range of healthcare organizations including pharmacies and long term care and home health agencies, as well as hospitals and physician offices. The BCIN will also leverage the HIE to enhance coordination of care for patients with chronic diseases and facilitate quality measurement and reporting. The overarching objective of the BCIN is to enable meaningful use of health IT across a wide geographic region in order to demonstrate measurable improvement in health care quality, cost efficiency, and population health, with particular focus on management of one of the most intractable chronic diseases facing our nation, diabetes. As such, the goals to be accomplished through the 36-month project period include: ? Increasing meaningful use of health information technology for all medical conditions ? Promoting cost efficiency by reducing use and costs of emergent and inpatient care for diabetes-related complications ? Improving quality of care by increasing compliance with diabetes preventive health services ? Improving core preventive measures for individuals with diabetes ? Promoting care coordination across the state and across the country by connecting the BCIN to the Washington and Idaho state health information exchanges and to the Nationwide Health Information Exchange  The wide geographic region representing the BCIN is predominantly rural, with a large proportion of traditionally medically underserved populations. There are strong referral relationships and extensive patient movement across the region.

This $520M proposal emphasizes green MW delivery through innovative application of today's technology while establishing integrated and crosscutting systems to create capabilities necessary for the grid of tomorrow. As a multi-state integrated investor owned utility, Progress Energy brings a unique opportunity to accelerate deployment of nearly 1000 green MW of efficiency and demand response and will optimize the value across our entire enterprise. These investments will also result in accelerating future investments beyond the grant period, delivering nearly 2300 MW by 2019, maximizing the value of DOE's investment.  This program leverages existing Program/Project Management organizational structures, standards, and disciplines to manage for on-time, on-budget delivery while ensuring benefits realization and includes the following activities and business drivers: - Transition past demand side investments to Smart Grid compatible infrastructure to preserve, re-purpose and extend benefits - Deploy AMI infrastructure that establishes a scalable platform for cost effective AMR-AMI migration and positions for dynamic rates - Deploy grid management functionality that replaces emergency voltage reduction with utility-side demand response capability for routine operational use - Deploy monitoring capability to critical transmission infrastructure for asset and demand management functionality - Deploy feeder automation to advance partial restoration capabilities - Build an advanced analytics engine that forecasts, coordinates and models a comprehensive view of Smart Grid energy and efficiency capabilities This deployment will be a utility model for efficiency and load shaping representing over 4.5% of Progress Energy's generation capacity. If scaled nationally, this could represent 44,700 MW, reduce 3.5M tons of CO2 emissions annually, be an important part of meeting Federal RES standards, and produce a present value savings of $270M over 10 years based on Cap-and-Trade policies currently being debated .","200,000,000",200000000,The Optimized Energy Value Chain,"Q4 2013 DSDR-Florida -Midpoint recloser control replacements - Commissioned 202 units.

Under the final requirements, as amended through the interim final requirements published in the Federal Register in January 2010, school improvement funds are to be focused on each State's 'Tier I' and 'Tier II' schools.  Tier I schools are a State's persistently lowest-achieving Title I schools in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring and, if a State so chooses, certain Title I eligible elementary schools that are as low achieving as the State's other Tier I schools. Tier II schools are a State's persistently-lowest achieving secondary schools that are eligible for, but do not receive, Title I, Part A funds and, if a State so chooses, certain additional Title I eligible secondary schools that are as low achieving as the State's other Tier II schools or that have had a graduation rate below 60 percent over a number of years.

The award is made to the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) for the construction of the Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV) based on the approval to proceed received from the National Science Board in March 2009.  Delivery of the vessel is anticipated in fall 2013 with science operations beginning in the summer of 2014. Technical Description: The 261-foot Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV) will be a multipurpose research ship that will dramatically improve access to Arctic waters and expand current scientific capabilities in the region. It is designed specifically to operate in seasonal sea ice and open ocean waters in the polar regions worldwide, but with a focus on the Arctic. To do so, the hull is ice-strengthened to American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) ice classification PC-5. The ARRV will provide a much needed, technologically-advanced oceanographic platform to enable multidisciplinary teams to conduct field research at the ice edge and in seasonal sea ice up to 3 feet thick. The ARRV will have many advanced capabilities including next-generation science handling systems to improve safety and efficiency at sea, and a modern suite of satellite communications to link the ship to educational facilities ashore. It is designed to have a minimal influence on its own environment, including low underwater radiated noise (URN) for fisheries and acoustics research, and reduced stack emissions to enable atmospheric research. With 24 dedicated science berths, the ARRV will be able to accommodate over 500 researchers and students annually and spend as many as 300 days at sea. The anticipated operational lifetime of the ARRV is at least 30 years.  Broader Impacts: Scientific interest in the Arctic region is intensive and highly varied. For example, dramatic changes in biological productivity have been predicted as a consequence of progressive warming, continuing ice recession, changing ocean currents, ocean acidification, and varying climatic conditions. Changing Arctic climate may well be one of the critical drivers for climate change over the entire planet. Besides biological and climatological changes, the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian areas are also subject to major seismic processes.  Extending our knowledge about subduction zones and the eruptive history of seafloor volcanoes would help predict the potential risk for devastating tsunamis. All of these scientific missions and activities are of continuing interest and great importance not only to the U.S., but also to the economic and environmental welfare of the entire globe.  The ARRV will be named the R/V SIKULIAQ and will replace the R/V ALPHA HELIX which was operated by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.

To ensure the success of apprentice recruiting efforts, a pre-apprenticeship program will be used to determine the applicants that will be most successful and provide ground labor when needed.  The project will result in up to 450 new apprenticeship positions over a 36 month period as well as a career path/advancements for these 450 individuals who will move from pre-apprentices to apprentices to journeyment.  This project will also result in the training of current line workers (current apprentices, journeymen, ground hands, equipment operators etc.).    ","1,558,436",1558436,Workforce Development,"No new boot camps were held during the quarter but training of apprentices and journeymen did occur during the quarter especially during October and November before major storm weather hit the region.  The following courses for apprentices and journeymen took place during the quarter:  Three Phase Transformers, CDL Training and Road Testing, Climbing 2 and 3, Test Framing 2, Pole Framing, Introduction to Transformers, NJATC Rigger/Signal Person, CPR First Aid and Supervised Testing.  A total of 149 Apprentices (both the 131 new apprentices recruited/retained since the start of this program and those that were apprentices before this program) received ongoing on-the-job training. The program dictates that apprentices move through strict training phases and be tested on each one.  Therefore, activities during the quarter also included testing of apprentices on a number of job responsibilities.  A total of 8 apprentices graduated to journeyman status during the quarter and 2 dropped out of the program.  ",More than 50% Completed,"A total of 131 line worker apprentices were recruited, completed their initial training (called boot camp) and remained in the program working at least part time during the quarter (since Program Inception) .  No new boot camps were run in the quarter.   Boot camps are planned for the first quarter of 2014.    All 131 apprentices worked full time during the quarter.   An analysis of actual hours worked by all apprentices shows that there were 1.49 FTE for each apprentice.         For the purpose of this report, we count all NEW line worker jobs created and retained since the start of the Grant.  Pro-rating for the actual FTE hours worked, a total of 195.19 line worker FTE were retained during the quarter.   In addition, 4 FTE of Training/Admin staff were also reported for the period.  In summary 199.19 FTE were retained during the quarter.  Since this project is funded 50% with ARRA funds, this translates to a total of 99.60 FTE.  Note ? new line worker apprentices receive formal classroom training on weekends (Boot Camp and other formal training) and on-the-job training during the week.  As soon as an apprentice starts training, he/she also becomes eligible to work for local electrical contractors.  Because of the demand for workers in this field, most apprentices begin working full-time immediately.  Therefore, while the apprentices are not directly supported by ARRA funds, the intense training they receive through these ARRA funds makes them eligible to work as a line worker in a demand industry.  Thus, new line worker apprentices recruited and retained in the program are counted as FTE.   ","15,646.95",99.6,1335116.42,1362494.64,0,,NY,US,Albany,42.652711,-73.760703,

The research is clear - having an effective teacher for consecutive years can close the persistent achievement gap faced by poor and minority students. Yet despite the recognized importance of effective teachers, virtually no educator preparation program requires teachers to demonstrate effectiveness in increasing student achievement in order to receive certification and remain in the classroom. The New Teacher Project (TNTP) is therefore implementing an effectiveness-based teacher preparation program, the Teacher Effectiveness and Certification (TEACh) Initiative, which draws on our successful, research-backed Teaching Fellows Programs (TFP) and Practitioner Teacher Programs (PTP) to provide high-need districts with a teacher pipeline that seamlessly spans activities from recruitment to certification and only certifies teachers who have demonstrated effectiveness in the classroom.   With i3 funding, TNTP is partnering with six sites - Charlotte-Mecklenburg, Chicago, DC, Fort Worth, Metro Nashville, and New Orleans (includes Recovery School District and almost 40 participating charter schools) - to implement the TEACh Initiative, in which we will pair our TFP and PTP models to establish high-quality teacher pipelines. In addition, we will select, retain and certify only those candidates whose students are making significant academic gains, by introducing effectiveness screens at key points in the teacher pipeline continuum. Partner districts have agreed to support TNTP's outplacement decisions by not retaining Fellows who are denied certification.   The goal of this initiative is to Increase the number of demonstrably effective teachers in partner LEAs. By the end of the grant period, we aim to achieve the following: recruit, select, and train 2,450 - 3,300 new teachers who have shown the potential to be effective; prepare 1,850-2,475 new teachers using a student achievement focused certification curriculum; and certify and retain only teachers who have demonstrated effectiveness in the classroom. By Year 5 of the grant period, we expect to impact an estimated 253,000-337,000 high-need students.

Pre-service planning is underway in all sites, including determining the school(s) that will host field training and meeting spaces for each program. Each site?s TNTP Academy staff has completed about half of the total planned seminar sessions, which combine content pedagogy and time to practice Teach Like a Champion techniques in service to rigorous and skillful delivery of content.  Each site gathered feedback via early check-in survey, distributed to all first-year Fellows. With support from the central assessment and evaluation team, staff identify important trends in the feedback and use these to drive adjustments in program interventions. The first round of Assessment of Classroom Effectiveness (ACE) observations were completed for each Fellow by observers in IL, TN and TX.

Despite the wealth of these opportunities, none are located in the District of Columbia. As a result, the District itself has not benefited significantly from the biotechnology revolution, and there are few opportunities for high tech jobs in the area of biotechnology. The proposed renovation project will expand biotechnology capacity through new equipment, increased efficiencies in space, more research to translating discoveries into products, and through allowing increased recruitments at the faculty and staff level. As a result, we anticipate increased workforce demands at our Research Center. Therefore, the proposed Research Center, in addition to conducting important translational research on NIPs, will also afford an unprecedented opportunity for capacity building in the area of biotechnology within the District.

NJ-HITEC?s mission is to assist New Jersey?s health care providers achieve meaningful use of health information technology through its program of outreach, consultation and user support. The Center has an aggressive goal of reaching all the state?s 14,000 primary care providers serving at-risk population centers with the message of improved health care quality and reduced cost of operation that begins with the adoption of Electronic Healthcare Record systems (EHR).  Roughly 80% of those providers practice in areas with the state?s at-risk patients - the large urban regions of Newark, Trenton, Camden and Atlantic City.  They operate in diverse environments that include: individual or small group primary care providers, FQHCs, community clinics, and critical access hospitals. These providers will be the primary target for grant assisted services supporting them through full EMR adoption by end of program funding.  NJ-HITEC staff offer client practices ?one-stop? shopping, coordinating the delivery of services and technology from public and private sources. This ?brokered service? organizational model is based upon NJIT?s decades of experience in running statewide extension efforts resulting in nearly $200 million in cost savings, new or retained sales and 3,000 jobs created or retained. It leverages existing public and private sector partners and eliminates the need for large administrative overhead.  Using a phased approach that begins with statewide Electronic Medical Record system awareness training and brings client providers through assessment, system selection, installation and ongoing user training, the Center will move New Jersey?s primary care practitioners to achieve meaningful use.  The program plan is designed to launch an intensive conversion effort in the early years of funding.  The longer-term program, beyond four-year federal support, will shift to continuous enhancement of the digitized practice, and improved integration across all stakeholders in the healthcare delivery system. New Jersey?s 19 community colleges will act as exclusive partners for the delivery of outreach and awareness training throughout the state.  Those efforts are complemented by NJIT?s Division of Continuing and Professional Education.

The UNC EFRC focuses its research on the generation of solar fuels using artificial photosynthesis. This highly research intensive target is being addressed by a distinguished group of faculty in a highly collaborative environment leveraging key discoveries made at UNC over the past 20 years. UNC EFRC is a collaborative partnership with Duke University, North Carolina Central University, the University of Florida, Research Triangle Institute, Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Colorado at Boulder, forming a criti¬cal mass of scientists collaborating on energy-related research. The UNC EFRC is developing collaborative research partnerships with regional and international institutions and organizations.  MISSION Our mission is to conduct the basic research that will enable a revolution in the collection and conversion of sunlight into storable solar fuels. The center integrates nationally recognized research expertise and capabilities in synthesis, electrochemistry, photochemistry, mechanism, nanomaterials, polymer science, inorganic materials, organic electronics, advanced spectroscopy and theory in four interdependent research areas:   1.  Catalysis Our research integrates light absorption and electron transfer driven catalysis in molecular assemblies and compos¬ite materials to create efficient devices for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen and by reducing carbon dioxide to the fuels methanol and hydrocarbons. Primary goals are the elucida¬tion of mechanism using cutting edge experimental and theoretical methods, development of new catalysts, and structural integration across multiple length scales in working device prototypes.   2.  Assemblies Research thrusts include the study of rapid and efficient energy transfer in prototypical assemblies based on structurally controlled, derivatized polymers, and the design of polypeptide assemblies to precisely position molecular sub-units in three dimensions at the molecular level.  Organic-inorganic hybrid materials for integrated light-harvesting and catalysis are being pursued.  3.  Interfacial Synthesis, Stabilization, Structure & Dynamics The focus is on developing robust catalyst and light-harvesting assemblies for photo-induced water oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction.  We are developing a fundamental understanding of the light-driven interfacial kinetics of dyes, assemblies and catalysts bound to metal oxide semiconductors.     4.  Devices We are developing metal oxide semiconductors with desirable band energy properties and in particular oxide semiconductor anodes with sufficiently high conduction levels to allow carbon dioxide reduction. We are developing integrated catalysts, assemblies and new transparent metal-oxide semiconductors in device prototype configurations.   MANAGEMENT & INFRASTRUCTURE The UNC EFRC is guided by an innovative management plan combining the strongest features of research and research management in academia with those of the national laboratories to create a sustained, world-class research effort in solar fuels.  Our integrated research team structure is designed to maximize collaborations.    BUDGET UNC EFRC manages a budget of $17.5 million over 5 years along with significant matching fund support from UNC. To en¬sure research focus and continuity, EFRC practices continuous research oversight and review through internal and external advisory committees.

These thrusts are further subdivided into 8 research teams in a modular structure that maximizes existing research strengths in an interactive environment, promotes integrated collaborative research and enables the EFRC to address high priority national Energy Grand Challenge needs.  Progress was made in key areas: (1) Following recent advances in combining chromophore-catalyst assemblies with core-shell structures, we worked toward optimization of these components in dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells for sustained visible light-driven water oxidation. (2) We worked to finalize the UNC EFRC renewal proposal to the U.S. Department of Energy due on January 9, 2014. (3) The Center now has 158 papers published or accepted in peer-reviewed journals, 19 submitted, and many more in preparation. (4) We sponsored three EFRC seminars by visiting speakers in the field of solar fuels research.  (5) We initiated a monthly “theory club” to bring UNC EFRC researchers together to discuss cutting-edge computational techniques and to develop collaborations with experimentalists. (6) 40 research team meetings were held to plan/review research and to foster collaboration. (7) We continued collaboration with the Los Alamos NL EFRC Center for Advanced Solar Photophysics CASP to develop strategies for tethering molecular catalysts on semiconducting quantum dot materials. Discussions continued with the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis on complementary studies in numerical modeling of device performance (JCAP) integrated with atomistic modeling of processes in DSPEC devices (UNC EFRC). (8) We continued working with Research Triangle Institute to develop an industrial advisory consortium to guide the development of technologies with commercialization potential.

It is based on a plan to bring 5,100 priority primary care providers (PCPs) in the 57 New York counties outside of New York City to meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs) over the next 2 years, with thousands more primary care and specialty clinicians to follow over the following 2 years. This goal is no doubt a challenging one, given the large numbers of providers involved, the broad geography, and the wide diversity of care settings that the NYeC RHITEC Program will encompass. However, we are confident in our approach, as it combines a strong state health care information technology infrastructure that has been created by the $500M HEAL-NY health care IT capital investment program led by NYeC, with the EHR implementation proficiency of MAeHC, a nationally recognized health IT consulting organization. The NYeC RHITEC Program will offer statewide RHITEC coverage through a combination of centralized services and distributed services that will supply providers with the knowledge, training, and confidence they will need to successfully select and deploy an EHR and use health information meaningfully. As a result of the last 5 years of HEAL-NY investments, New York has a robust network of Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs) and Community Health IT Adoption Collaborations (CHITAs) that will be utilized to provide physicians with local implementation support, while NYeC will deploy centralized service programs which will be shared collectively throughout the state. Additionally, NYeC will develop a comprehensive method of tracking EHR adoption that will help guide our efforts and inform future investments in New York's EHR adoption programs. Finally, the NYeC recognizes that early EHR adoption services will be largely labor intensive, but through the course of the program it plans to explore other potentially breakthrough strategies, which could lead to more efficient adoption, and new and sustainable business models.

The five transit capital projects are Eads Bridge Rehabilitation, North Hanley Parking Lot & Bus Loop Improvements, Public Art, Rail & Tie Replacement, and UMSL Interlocking.  A brief description of each project follows.  Eads Bridge Rehabilitation:  MetroLink trains run along a double track located on the lower rail deck of the Eads Bridge.  The Eads Bridge crosses the Mississippi River to connect Missouri and Illinois.  Time and weather have deteriorated the masonry and steel structural elements of the bridge.  In this design/build project, the structural elements to be repaired or replaced will be identified, the necessary repairs/replacements will be made and the bridge's surface will be completely recoated.  North Hanley Parking Lot Replacement & Bus Loop Improvement:  The North Hanley MetroLink Station parking lot provides short term parking for passengers accessing both Metro's light rail & bus service.  It was constructed as part of the original alignment over 16 years ago.  It is in poor condition; there have been no significant repairs except for striping & patching since it was placed in service.  This project will remove and replace approximately 393,000 square feet of asphalt parking lot surface, defective sidewalks, ramp surfaces and deteriorated curbs.  Additionally, the bus loop will be replaced and two saw tooth bus bays will be added adjacent to the existing bus bays.   Public Art:  This is a 1% enhancement project that will install public art at seven Missouri MetroLink stations along the original Missouri alignment.  The seven stations are Arch-Laclede's Landing, Stadium, Union Station, Central West End, Wellston, UMSL North and Lambert Airport Main Terminal.  Rail & Tie Replacement:  The original Phase I Missouri MetroLink alignment was constructed on portions of existing railroad right-of-way using the existing rail.  Many of the locations along the alignment, passenger stations and low-grade areas require modifications to prolong the life of the light rail system.  Existing wood ties will be replaced with concrete ties that last longer and are more durable than the existing ones.  This project also replaces existing track with new rail and replaces/repairs pedestrian walkways along the alignment.  UMSL Interlocking:  This project modifies existing signal and train control, communications, overhead catenary, and track system elements to install a new fully powered, signalized universal crossover east of the existing UMSL South MetroLink Station.  Project activities will include the installation of new rail, concrete ties, corrosion control fasteners, turnouts on concrete ties, catenary poles, sectionalization insulators, audio-frequency & power signal house, auto - transfer standby generator, SCADA modifications, wayside signals & apparatus, retaining wall, fencing and integration testing.

At the nanoscale lignocellulose is a highly versatile composite of three complex biopolymers, namely, crystalline nm-scale fibrils of cellulose which are linked together by less-ordered polysaccharides (such as xylans) and embedded in lignin, a complex and heterogeneous phenolic macromolecule. Despite its huge economic importance, many aspects of lignocellulose structure and formation remain shrouded in mystery. For instance, little is known of the details of how the cellulose-synthesizing nano-machine at the cell surface links simple sugar molecules into long strands and extrudes them at the cell surface in such a way that they make a strong, insoluble and highly inert crystalline fibril. In addition to its current economic importance as a biomaterial, lignocellulose is also the largesi store of renewable solar energy on Earth. DOE recently established three centers to develop cellulosic biomass into an economic transportation fuel. The fundamental knowledge and technical expertise to be developed by the Center is essential for designing novel ways to manipulate plant cell walls, an important step in unlocking the energy-rich cell wall for the next generation of sustainable biofuels and for creating new cellulosic biomaterials with diverse economic applications. Additionally, the understanding of how nature creates this most versatile of biocompo sites could be used to create new composites based on different polymers.","21,000,000",17306349,CENTER FOR LIGNOCELLULOSE STRUCTURE AND FORMATION,"1)We sponsored lodging for researcher Marie Dumont from the University of Rouen for collaborative research under the direction of Dr. Charles Anderson for 5 weeks.

The Institute for Social Research (ISR) has played a major role in this evolution of social science research on health, and it has at present nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in active NIH supported studies, ranging from small clinical studies, to community interventions, to long-running longitudinal panel studies on large population based samples. In fact, the 20-year Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a major beneficiary of the proposed infrastructure expansion, is the largest single NIH grant at the University of Michigan, a university that ranks among the U.S. leaders in NIH supported bio-medical research. Over this same period, there has been almost a revolution in the nature of health related social and behavioral science research, with the increasing development of more sophisticated theoretical models and hypotheses that include biometric and biological measures and the use of genetic material. This evolution has been furthered by the amazing increase in knowledge propelled by advances in molecular biological technologies, and especially brain sciences. Again the ISR has played a major role in these developments. Studies like the HRS now routinely collect biological and biometric measures, and the interdisciplinary base of ISR’s NIH research has evolved to include research physicians, geneticists, epidemiologists, and other health scientists working in concert with psychologists, sociologists, and economists. These changes have resulted in a large expansion of both the type and quantity of research scientists and, simply put, the ISR is fast running out of space. New space must be suited for this new type of social and behavioral science research, storage, and retrieval facilities, as well as for the generation of new scientists that are needed, and are rapidly being hired, to work on this cutting edge of the social determinants (and correlates) of health and diseases.

58891,Office of Science,8925,Office of Science,89-0227,,2013,4,1,Grant,8/1/2009,"In Photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric (TE) energy conversion, the process by which incident light or heat energy is transformed into useful electricity is composed of a series of mechanisms that each have an intrinsic efficiency.  Energy loss in these mechanisms, primarily due to coupling between charge carriers and thermal vibrations, determines the overall conversion efficiency of the process.  However, fundamental study of PV and TE loss mechanisms has proven difficult due to the short time and length scales over which they occur. Emerging advances in ultrafast optical science hold promise for understanding these building blocks of energy conversion.  Pump-probe techniques that can span femtosecond to nanosecond time scales and simultaneously achieve atomic-scale resolution have recently been developed, in particular by the ultrafast optics community at the University of Michigan.  Furthermore, advances in the synthesis and fabrication of nanocomposites with precisely tuned physical and chemical structure have provided a materials basis on which to conduct fundamental measurements of electron, phonon, and photon transport. We propose to apply these techniques in establishing an Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC) devoted to the study of fundamental loss mechanisms in PV and TE energy conversion.  The integrated theoretical, experimental and computational framework of this Center will examine transport processes in organic, inorganic, and organic-inorganic hybrid materials, developing basic understanding to underpin approaches for radically increased conversion efficiency.  We will examine the influence of atomic and electronic structure on the dynamics of transport by phonons and free or bound (exciton) charge carriers that govern the TE figure of merit and PV efficiency.  In particular, we will utilize low-dimensional structures such as epitaxial quantum dot (QD) superlattices and colloidal nanocrystals to investigate the influence of nanostructure size, shape, band offset, arrangement, and surface polarity on electronic and thermal transport.  Exciton generation, relaxation, diffusion, and dissociation in highly controlled organic and hybrid PV materials will be studied using ultrafast optical and scanning probe techniques.  We will examine charge injection at organic-inorganic interfaces, as well as charge transport in ordered and disordered organic thin films.  For TE material in particular, we will utilize low-dimensional structures to examine phonon scattering and electron-phonon coupling mechanisms, analyzing the effects of carrier confinement and modifications to the electronic density of states. The impact of this research will address two important questions:  (1)  How does the surface/interface of low-dimensional structures such as nanoparticle,  nanowire, or thin film influence the structure’s energy level and coupling rates?  (2)  How does the arrangement of interacting, low-dimensional structures (in, for example, a  QD superlattice) control the macroscale energy levels and coupling rates?

North Carolina will establish a comprehensive regional extension center (REC) to support primary care providers in adopting EHRs and utilizing  health information technology effectively to improve the quality of health care throughout the state.  The North Carolina Area Health Education Centers (NC AHEC) Program housed at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill will use its existing regional infrastructure to hire and train over 40 new positions in nine regions across the state to provide on-site technical assistance to primary care providers.   The NC AHEC - REC will provide primary care practices and providers with on-site assistance in the areas of practice workflow and redesign, EHR selection and implementation, functional interoperability and health information exchange, as well as privacy and security training. Additionally, NC AHEC - REC will provide the opportunity to group purchase a vendor product, and provide education, library, and quality improvement assistance. Finally, NC AHEC – REC will participate in a National Learning Consortium to assist the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to meet its national objective for widespread EHR adoption and meaningful use.  Target priority primary-care providers  NC AHEC – REC will target services to primary care providers including physicians, physicians’ assistants and nurse practitioners in individual and small group practices, who are either rural, connected to public and Critical Access Hospitals, housed in Community Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics, or practicing in other settings that accommodate uninsured, underinsured, and medically underserved populations.    Significant partnerships To ensure its success, NC AHEC will draw on the expertise of four significant partners: The Carolina Center for Medical Excellence (CCME), the North Carolina Medical Society Foundation (NCMSF), the Institute for Public Health, and Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC).  Anticipated outcomes, products, and duration   Over the span of two years, NC AHEC - REC will assist at least 770 primary care practices/3,465 primary care providers with EHR adoption and optimization and 350 practices/600 providers with group purchasing services. Education, library, and quality improvement assistance will be provided to 1,000 practices/6,300 providers across the state.    The long-term vision of NC AHEC – REC is to develop a robust HIT environment based in quality improvement that engages consumers, expands information sharing among key users including primary care providers, consultants, care managers, hospitals, pharmacies, and labs, and informs clinical decision making across multiple disciplines and from all practice settings.

Our objective is to supersede traditional electronics with devices that use excitons to mediate the flow of energy. Excitons are quasiparticle excitations consisting of a bound electron and hole that mediate the absorption and emission of light, especially in disordered and low-dimensional materials.    The motivation for excitonics is that conventional electronic devices can be difficult to manufacture; their constituent materials require very high levels of order, and achieving such low entropy in a semiconductor requires expensive and energy intensive fabrication. For example, the energy payback time for a crystalline silicon solar cell is on the order of 2 years, and at current manufacturing growth rates, it is expected to take at least 20 years to produce enough silicon-based solar cells to make a significant impact on the world energy supply. Similarly, epitaxial growth constraints are likely to limit solid state lighting sources to a small fraction of the overall demand for lighting.     There is an alternate approach that is more suitable for large scale production. In the Center for Excitonics, we address materials with only short-range order. Such nanostructured materials are compositions of nano-engineered elements such as organic molecules, polymers, or quantum dots and wires, in films bound together by weak van der Waals bonds. These materials are characterized by excitons that are localized within the ordered nanostructures. Excitons provide a unique means to transport energy and convert between photons and electrons. Due to localization of excitons, the optical properties of the films are relatively immune to longer-range structural defects and disorder in the bulk. And in contrast with the painstaking growth requirements of conventional semiconductors, weak van der Waals bonds allow excitonic materials to be readily deposited on a variety of materials at room temperature.     We address two grand challenges in excitonics: (1) to understand, control and exploit exciton transport, and (2) to understand and exploit the energy conversion processes between excitons and electrons, and excitons and photons.     (1) Exciton Transport: We will develop new theory to explain and model the movement of excitons in complex nanostructures. We will build artificial excitonic antennas that absorb and guide light in nanofabricated circuits of molecular chromophores, J-aggregates, quantum dots and nanowires. We will characterize coherence and energy transfer in our antennas using scanning probe microscopy and our recently developed technique of fully phase coherent 2-d Fourier transform spectroscopy. Finally, our excitonic technologies will be applied to low cost solar cells and luminescent solar concentrators, which promise power efficiencies > 30%.    (2) Exciton Dynamics: We will develop new theory for the dynamics of exciton formation and separation. Applications include increasing the efficiency of organic light emitting devices by up to a factor of four and characterizing the fundamental efficiency limits of excitonic solar cells. We will develop two important tools that are unique to the center: Cathodo-luminescence Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (CL-STEM), which will be used to characterize the structure-function relationships of excitonic nanomaterials, and Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors (SNSPDs). SNSPDs can conclusively determine the efficiency of multiple carrier generation, a process with enormous potential for solar cells. Finally, we will characterize the link between exciton annihilation and device degradation.","19,000,000",16344814,"TAS::89 0227::TAS Recovery Act - Center for Excitonics - EFRC, Project 2005000","Excitons are the crucial intermediate for energy transduction in low cost, disordered semiconductors.

This will be pursued via experimental and computational approaches, with research thrusts in fuel cells and batteries and multi-layer complex oxides.  The nature and structure of interfaces are key to energy generation, conversion and storage. Despite their fundamental importance and technological relevance, our understanding of these processes is, at best, rudimentary, due to the lack of well-defined experimental and computational systems, as well as techniques that can provide structural and compositional information in-situ and under realistic operating conditions.  Our work seeks to provide the fundamental knowledge base for the rational development of new materials, as well as the experimental and computational tools necessary for and critical to optimization of properties and performance.  Our main objectives are: • Achieve a microscopic understanding of the effects of the nature and structure of nano-structured interfaces including metal/electrolyte, metal/conducting polymer, and at “atomically engineered” complex oxides, on energy generation, conversion and storage  • Develop and apply novel experimental tools for probing the structure, composition and dynamics of interfaces under operating conditions • Develop and employ computational and modeling platforms to understand the fundamentals underlying the above phenomena  Thurst A: Fuel Cells and Batteries This thrust builds on the accomplishments of the Cornell Fuel Cell Institute which is focused on designing/discovering new materials to address critical needs in fuel cell technologies and expands on them to apply a similar approach to the discovery of new materials for electrical energy storage applications with emphasis on batteries. Fuel cells efforts will focus on materials that could revolutionize the key components of the fuel cell: the catalysts, catalyst supports, and ionic membranes by exploiting, extending and understanding recent discoveries. We have expertise in materials synthesis, combinatorial methodologies, nanoparticle synthesis and mesostructured composites, and in a vast array of bulk and surface characterization methods, and a strong coupling to theory.  A new aspect involves the study of complex metal oxides as potential electrocatalysts and supports.  In electrical energy storage, the emphasis will be on the search of new materials and control of nanostructures and architectures.   We will capitalize on recent discoveries that the control of the nanostructure can yield high capacity materials that can be cycled extensively while minimizing capacity fade. We will also explore the use of organosulfur materials in battery applications.  Thrust B: Complex Oxides Our team will design, synthesize, and characterize novel complex oxide nanostructures and interfacial materials for fuel cell and battery applications. We will use ab-initio calculations to design candidate electrode and catalyst oxides by tuning strain and interface stabilization to design and control non-bulk properties.  A new joint-DFT method will be employed to predict the stability and termination of liquid-solid interfaces for these heterostructures.  Defects and chemical reaction pathways will be modeled by phase-space search methods. Molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) will be exploited to build atomically-precise layered model heterostructures with controlled orientations and surface terminations. Electrochemical reactions will be studied in-situ and in real time using synchrotron X-ray techniques. Electron microscopy and spectroscopy will be used to analyze the structure and bonding of interfacial and reaction layers with atomic resolution in 2D and 1nm resolution in 3D.  Nanoparticles of the most promising candidates will be synthesized and characterized. ","17,327,638",17327638,"NANOSTRUCTURED INTERFACES FOR ENERGY GENERATION, CONVERSION AND STORAGE","One of the most attractive candidates for next-generation electrical energy storage is the Li/S system, by virtue of its high theoretical capacity of 1675 mAh/g and potentially high energy density. To realize this capacity, reversibly and safely in a battery, the cathode must be structured such that sulfur is in electrical contact while the polysulfides formed during cycling remain immobilized. At emc2 we established the “Lithium Sulfur Initiative” as an integrated effort to address these challenges with great success. Our recent advances in creating nanostructured sulfur-based cathodes include: cross-linked polyacrylonitrile/Li2Sx carbon composites, (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, 135, 763–767), Li2S in a porous carbon matrix (J. Mater. Chem. A 2012, 1, 1433), hollow carbon@sulfur composites (Angew. Chem. Int. Edit. 2011, 50, 5904–5908), polyaniline coated yolk-shell structures (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, 135, 16736–16743) and amylopectin wrapped graphene oxide/sulfur composites (ACS Nano 2013, 7, 8801–8808.) These nanostructured sulfur composites exhibited improved cycling performance for over 200 cycles and a stable charge capacity in excess of 750 mAh/g at 0.2C. We have combined computational methods and advanced operando X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy to better understand the fundamental reduction mechanism. We have combined experimental insights with statistical mechanics and ab initio calculations to predict the equilibrium composition and structure of Li-S. Coupling sulfur-composites to hierarchical carbons presents a promising route to create 3-D structures that mitigate dendrite formation. This is critical since the high energy density of Li/S is predicated on the use of a metallic lithium anode. Our 3-D gyroids from block-copolymers and mesoporous carbon foams (Energy Environ.

Due to an unemployment rate of over 12%, the foreclosure problem continues. The City of Los Angeles received $100 million in Neighborhood Stabilization Program 2 (NSP2) funds to acquire, rehabilitate and re-sell approximately 750 to 1,200 housing units, and to support NSP1 funded efforts. The number of units assisted will depend on the amount of NSP2 program income (i.e. loan repayments) generated for reuse, and the amount of leveraging achieved with other non-NSP2 funding sources.  The program is designed to reduce the number of vacant and abandoned properties, reduce the absorption period for sales of foreclosed properties, and stabilize home values in the target neighborhoods.  The NSP2 target areas were selected based on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Foreclosure Risk Scores, showing that the City?s hardest hit areas are the Eastside, South Los Angeles and parts of the San Fernando Valley.  The NSP2 target areas cover less than 10% of the city but experienced one-third of all foreclosures.  NSP2 objectives are to acquire, rehabilitate and resell foreclosed or vacant/abandoned homes in the NSP2 target areas, to implement green building standards, to support and enhance NSP1 projects already underway, and to provide mortgage financing assistance and rehabilitation loans for the purchase and rehabilitation of foreclosed homes for individuals and families.  Building on the infrastructure created for NSP1, the Los Angeles Housing and Community Investment Department (HCIDLA) will carry out NSP2 activities in several ways: through bulk purchase of foreclosed properties from lenders and the secondary market, through direct assistance to homebuyers, and through identification of distressed abandoned and/or foreclosed properties and their disposition via Request for Proposals (RFP) or other competitive processes.  The City?s NSP2 program will transform some of the most blighted housing into attractive properties rehabilitated to the Green Communities Standard.  HCIDLA focuses on properties that are least likely to be purchased because of the amount of rehabilitation needed.  By purchasing or providing incentives to purchase these properties, HCIDLA will remove some of the worst eye-sores and opportunities for criminal activities.  Since neighborhood stabilization is a primary objective of NSP2, foreclosed properties near the worst properties will also be acquired and repaired so that there are a sufficient number of rehabilitated properties to increase market values and decrease absorption time.  With the NSP2 funds, HCIDLA proposes to acquire, rehabilitate and re-sell approximately 260 single family homes and 940 units of multifamily rental properties.  This goal will be achieved beyond the three-year grant period as funds are recycled through the program.  NSP2 funds will pay for numerous construction and administrative jobs, and indirectly support local real estate and building supply enterprises.  In the short term, the City hopes to arrest the decline in home values based on average sales price and reduce vacant and abandoned residential property in the targeted neighborhoods.  Longer term outcomes include increasing sales of residential property and the median market values of real estate in the targeted neighborhoods.  The City?s NSP2 activities will directly benefit persons and households whose incomes do not exceed 120% of the local Area Median Income (AMI).  At least 25 % of NSP2 funding will be used for purchase and redevelopment of abandoned or foreclosed residential properties primarily as affordable rental housing opportunities for households whose incomes do not exceed 50% AMI.  Up to 10% will be used for program administration, staffing and other costs of the HCIDLA and the City?s NSP subrecipient, Restore Neighborhoods LA, Inc.

Our center will be called CITFAM (Center for Integrated Training in Far-from-equilibrium and Adaptive Materials; Director: Bartosz A. Grzybowski; Associate Director: Mark A. Ratner) and will bring together a group of top-level investigators from Northwestern and Harvard Universities and the University of Michigan to attack two 'Grand Challenges' formulated in the DoE's Report: How to characterize and control matter away (especially very far away) from equilibrium and How to master energy and information on the nanoscale to create new technologies with capabilities rivaling those of living things. The main vision and goal of the Center is to combine the theory of non-equilibrium systems with cutting edge nanotechnology and materials science to synthesize, characterize and understand in quantitative detail fundamentally new classes of materials. These materials, while structurally robust, will have the ability to change and optimize their own performance (in harnessing and processing energy, hydrogen storage, catalysis, etc.) in response to external/environmental stimuli. Creation of such 'adaptive' materials that operate and/or maintain states away from thermodynamic equilibrium has the potential to revolutionize materials science and shift its focus from 'static,' equilibrium structures to 'dynamic,' multipurpose materials. The three chief goals of this research are:  1. Significant fundamental insights into the nature of far-from-equilibrium kinetics, dynamics, and structure formation for both quantum and classical systems.   2. A robust set of well-characterized, well-modeled physical systems in which far-fromequilibrium behaviors can be used to capture, transduce, store, and utilize many forms of energy.   3. A diverse group of graduates (undergraduate, doctoral, and postdoctoral) proficient in the preparation, measurement, and conceptual understanding of far-from-equilibrium systems. These graduates will be a central part of the human resources that the US requires to build a secure energy future based on understanding and creating new materials. The Center will be built around a core (a 'Think Tank') of expert theorists (Glotzer, Olvera, Ottino, Ratner, Schatz, Szleifer) who interact closely with experimentalists (Grzybowski, Mirkin, Stoddart, Stupp, Weiss, Whitesides) working in six carefully selected 'Focus Areas' combining the fundamentals of non-equilibrium research with the practice and applications of energyrelated material systems. Specific experimental targets will include situations such as extension minima in rotaxane-based artificial muscles, controlling reaction networks by real-time catalytic switching, directing energy flows in orthogonal directions in multi-component quantum dot arrays, controlled molecular quantum transport in rigid rod-like assemblies of nanoscale plasmonic electrodes, and systems of power-generating, autnonomous 'nanomovers'.","19,000,000",17183387,Center for Integrated Training in Far-from-Equilibrium and Adaptive Materials,"The project Non-equilibrium Energy Research Center (NERC) is highlighting during this reporting period is on a collaborative project, which concentrates on environmentally responsive energy conversion materials incorporating inorganic and organic components. The goal of the projects that fall under the umbrella of the above-mentioned title is to identify a set of organic and inorganic components (molecules/polymers and nanoparticles, respectively) that we could combine to make hybrid materials with properties sensitive to environmental stimuli, in particular, light, and to determine the mechanisms of these responses in order to guide the design of non-equilibrium, adapative materials. In this spirit, we used a diarylethylene (DAE) ligand, which adopts structures that are sensitive to the wavelength of light, to cross-link films of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) within electrical junctions with photoswitchable conductivity.  We achieved an enhancement of the photocurrent density of the cross-linked QD films by a factor of 6.5 when the DAE ligand was switched from its open, non-conductive form (by illumination with 500-650 nm light) to its closed, conductive form (by illumination with 300-400 nm light). This result is the first example of such a reversible enhancement accomplished by changing the inter-particle electronic coupling, not the inter-particle distance within a film of nanoparticles.   In collaboration with the Stoddard group, we also explored the photoelectrical properties of films of CdSe QDs and a redox-active polyviologen polymer. We studied the rates of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from CdSe QDs to poly(viologen) within thin films, as a function of the length of the ligands passivating the QDs. This study highlights the importance of molecular-level morphology of donor and acceptor materials in determining the rate and yield of interfacial photoinduced electron transfer in thin films.",More than 50% Completed,"American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds have significantly aided the research mission of Northwestern University by providing salary and wage compensation for individuals directly involved in ARRA-funded projects, both at Northwestern and at consortium institutions, as well as at the vendor organizations who provide goods and services in support of that mission.

This web application for hosting policy design and analysis over a common framework, saw considerable development, including features like a new interface for its policy authoring environment based on Google’s Blockly toolkit, a visual programming editor framework reminiscent of MIT’s Scratch language. We expanded our notion of the policy library to emphasize institutional policies as HIE becomes more widespread and data-sharing policies that are becoming commonplace as more Accountable Care Organizations are formed. Encryption and Trusted Base cluster:  Most projects in this cluster revolve around CHARM, our cryptographic framework for developing Healthcare applications securely. The system is being used both externally and internally. We worked on automating various crypto schemes as well as formally verifying security properties of our schemes. We continued work with Networking Health, the non-profit provider of medical records systems for free clinics in homeless shelters in Baltimore. Telemedicine cluster:  For project on “same body detection” we carried out more data collection using multiple Shimmer Wireless Sensor Units with 9 DoF (degrees of freedom) expansion modules. For project on “right body detection” we developed a wearable device and an out-of-lab study using this wearable device. This consists of a custom-designed daughterboard for the Shimmer Wireless Sensing Platform.

This data is then funneled into the National Broadband Map (www.broadbandmap.gov) created by the NTIA in partnership with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In addition, North Carolina developed a state-level map displaying broadband coverage (available at www.ncbroadband.gov), which is also updated twice a year. Coverage areas are displayed by broadband technology type, and by census block or street ranges, to help identify unserved and underserved pockets in North Carolina. There is one grant award per state. The original award, made in October 2009, included funding for two years for data collection and mapping, as well as funding for broadband planning efforts. In October 2010, supplemental funding was awarded for the following programs: State Capacity Building, Technical Assistance, a Computer Ownership Program known as LITE-UP, and Address File Development work.  Effective January 1, 2012, the North Carolina grant was transferred from the e-NC Authority to the NC Department of Commerce (Commerce) and is now being implemented by the Broadband Division (NC Broadband) of Commerce. In addition to the data collection, validation and display work, NC Broadband is continuing to develop and implement the supplemental programs mentioned above. As the State Broadband Initiative for North Carolina, NC Broadband works to build understanding at the State and regional level around broadband availability and the benefits of broadband, encouraging proactive goals related to broadband including adoption and use. The Technical Assistance program consists of an on-the-ground technical support team that is responsible for working with counties across the state to provide needed broadband expertise and help NC Broadband capture local level broadband resource information.  The Technical Assistance team works with local counties and communities primarily to address the overall importance of broadband access and the benefits of broadband; to foster understanding of broadband coverage and assist communities with broadband plans they wish to undertake; and to support local efforts for broadband planning including activities such as: surveys for greater granularity of information, focus on pockets of demand, broadband adoption work, or development of public access or digital literacy training programs. The purpose of the NC LITE-UP program (Linking Internet to Economically Underprivileged People) is to serve as a pilot for a national Lifeline Online program, in terms of offering lessons learned for consideration in a nationally-structured program. NC LITE-UP is also a research project, looking at barriers to broadband adoption. The goal of the program is to develop, deploy and test a model program to provide high-speed Internet service to low income families at reduced costs, along with free computers, access to a help desk, and digital literacy training to select participants. The NC Center for Geographic Information & Analysis (CGIA) is the lead organization in the state for geographic information systems (GIS) and is carrying out the Address File Development program under contract for Commerce. The primary goal of this project is to educate and support the North Carolina local government community in the development of higher quality address information, particularly in rural counties; to improve the overall quality of the statewide addressing dataset through engaging local governments, while implementing technical efficiencies to reduce the per-cycle costs for compilation at the statewide level; and to update the current Master Address File for the state of North Carolina. ","6,610,996",5834856,American Recovery and Reinvestment Act - SBDD - NC Department of Commerce,"In the fourth quarter of 2013 NC Broadband has focused on the following key activities. On September 30 NC Broadband had submitted the fall 2013 broadband availability data to the NTIA for the October 1 deadline, reflecting data from almost 80 broadband providers serving North Carolina with a total of 1,713,460 records submitted. In follow up to this submission, NC Broadband in the fourth quarter worked with contractor Michael Baker Jr. Inc. to update the online GIS map of broadband availability. In addition, individual county maps were completed to reflect the new data as well as calculation of household coverage percentages by county. The Technical Assistance staff members continued to reach out to counties across the state on broadband planning efforts.  An award was made to ECC Technologies for infrastructure inventories in multiple counties, to serve as a verification tool for the data collection work.  A database of Technical Assistance Activities was developed with the assistance of contractor Topsail Technologies.  Under the Capacity Building program, work continued on the Citizen Survey conducted by East Carolina University. In addition, work continued on the survey on broadband utilization by businesses and residents, in partnership with contractor Strategic Networks Group. Regional meetings on broadband were held in eastern NC on November 7 in Williamston and December 12 in Pembroke.

Project funding is in accordance with the: • American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), and the  • Broadband Data Improvement Act (BDIA) The Recovery Act requires the NTIA to develop and maintain a comprehensive, interactive and searchable nationwide map of existing broadband service availability in the United States.   The BDIA is intended to improve data to assist in the extension of broadband technology across all regions of the United States. The BDIA established the State Broadband Data Development program to award grants to eligible entities to develop statewide broadband maps.   In addition, awardees under this program receive grants to fund broadband-related programs at the state level.  On October 26, 2009 the New York State Office of Cyber Security received its first grant of $2,548,101, to fund the first 2 years of the 5 year Broadband Mapping Project.  The scope of the project includes:   • Data Collection, Integration, and Validation:  Collect comprehensive and accurate state-level broadband availability data.  Much of this data will be collected from broadband service providers. Other data sources, existing and to be created, will be used to validate the accuracy and completeness of these deliverables.  • Statewide Map:  Develop a state-level broadband map identifying available broadband service levels, the providers who deliver this service, as well as locations that are un-served and underserved.   • National Map:  Participate with the NTIA in the development and maintenance of the National Broadband Map (NBM). • Broadband Planning: Conduct a statewide initiative directed at planning for broadband expansion and increased adoption by the public.  On September 28, 2010, the Office of Cyber Security was awarded $6,375,431 in supplemental funding to continue data collection and mapping efforts from the original project scope, and to conduct the following additional activities in years 3 through 5 of the project: • Improving Address Files:  Develop statewide file of address locations to improve the accuracy of broadband availability data. • State Broadband Capacity Building: Provide funding for the New York State Broadband Program Office to continue its work in supporting broadband growth and adoption accross the state. • Technical Assistance-Digital Literacy Project:  Lack of computer and Internet skills is considered to be a significant impediment to expanding broadband adoption.  This project will fund a train-the-trainer program for librarians from within all NYS libraries. They, in turn, will be able to assist patrons with improving and expanding their “digital literacy”. The Office of Cyber Security is partnering with the New York Library Association to conduct this training.","8,923,532",8923532,New York State (NYS) Broadband Mapping Project ,"NY’s SBI project teams worked on a variety of tasks to further the goals of each SBI funded initiative. The Capacity Building team at the Department of Economic Development’s Broadband Program Office (BPO) worked closely with the Governor’s economic development team to make new plans that will continue the progress made thus far in improving broadband access in NY. Over the past two years, $68M of state funding was dedicated to improving broadband access in rural Upstate NY and underserved urban areas through funding from the Connect NY Broadband Grant Program and funding from the Regional Economic Development Councils’ (REDC) grant program. This represents the largest direct investment of state funding into expanding broadband access in the US.  The Mapping and Data Verification Team focused on enhancing the public broadband map to better serve the needs of the BPO and residents. Enhancements made will allow the public and BPO to track progress made on the Connect NY and REDC funded projects. The Mapping team also reconciled differences between the NCES list of K-12 schools and the schools in NY’s SBI community anchor institutions dataset.  NY’s Address File Project continued to progress nicely. Rooftop accuracy GIS address point files were delivered for 10 new counties bringing the total to 20.  These address points will facilitate building-level tracking of the progress being made in grant funded broadband infrastructure expansion projects. As a condition of accepting the funds, grantees are required to report all new locations served at the address level. These points also continue to be incorporated into a publicly available NYS “Enterprise” geocoding web service that will improve numerous public and private sector business functions that utilize address data.

Since then we have been conducting selective recruitment of additional PPCPs as needed and are also recruiting non-PPCPs to receive M-CEITA services. Much work has been done to ensure M-CEITA will remain a trusted resource to providers across Michigan even after the federally funded project has ended. In 2012 we originally launched several sustainability service programs including a subscription service for PPCPs that received REC subsidized services to continue working with M-CEITA as they move into Stage 2 MU and other quality improvement programs, a fee-for-service offering M-CEITA services to Specialists and other non PPCPs, and an in-depth practice improvement service called Targeted Practice Optimization (TPO). These programs were further refined into commercial service bundles in Q3 and Q4 of 2013.  Also in 2013 we began active recruitment and work with Medicaid Specialists under a grant from the State of Michigan using CMS IAPD funds.

With close to $500 million of investment made to date in health information technology, New York is now ready for immediate, large-scale health information exchange (HIE) implementation through this 4-year Program. The SHIN-NY will provide value through the services its provides and the number of participants consuming those services. These goals are mutually reinforcing: The greater the value of the services to the network, the more participants will want to join; the more participants, the more valuable the services. Striking the optimal balance of resource allocation and sequence of efforts in seeking enhanced services and increased participation will be critical to the sustainability of the SHIN-NY. Specifically, New York seeks to (1) increase the number and diversity of providers connected to the SHIN-NY including a continued focus on primary care physicians and hospitals, and new efforts to target home health, nursing home and behavioral health providers; (2) coordinate efforts linking State health information systems with the SHIN-NY; and (3) coordinate efforts to support health IT meaningful use through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. New York's governance model operates through a public-private partnership, including defined roles and responsibilities for the NYS Department of Health (DOH) and the New York eHealth Collaborative (NYeC), and a formal governance relationship with the Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs), which in turn provide governance for HIE at the regional and local levels. Building an effective statewide health IT capacity requires that all stakeholder groups forge consensus across a broad range of technical, policy, legal, implementation and business issues. New York has utilized and will build on its Statewide Collaboration Process (SCP) for this purpose. NYeC will use the initial months of the grant period to reach consensus on the exact configuration of HIE development. Because robust data exchange cannot happen without widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), , New York has created a network of Community Health IT Adoption Collaborations (CHITAs)/Regional Extension Centers to facilitate EHR adoption at the practice-level, whilch also supports effective integration with SHIN-NY and meaningful use across the state. The process also includes Statewide and other Associations, State agencies, the Health Information Technology Evaluation Collaborative (HITEC) and the Consumer Advisory Council. Building on the existing foundation of policy and operational activities, this Program will ensure that New York can provide (1) complete, accessible clinical information in the hands of both clinicians and patients, to support coordinated, preventive, patient-centered care; (2) more precise and timely information about what works in the real world to refine health care policies, monitor health status and safety, and guide physician and patient treatment choices; (3) integration of health care delivery information with public health surveillance systems to support public health goals; and (4) timely information about choices, prices, quality, and outcomes, enabling a truly patient-centered health system.","22,364,782",16254008,EXPANDING NEW YORK STATE'S HEALTH INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE,Immunization Bidirectional Information Exchange:  electronic reporting of immunizations to the NYSDOH via a RHIO intermediary in support of MU.

The State-wide Strategic Plan was recently revised to conform HIE planning in Massachusetts to the requirements of the federal State Health Information Exchange Cooperative Agreement Program. Massachusetts has a long and successful history using health information technology to support health care policy, beginning in 1978 with creation of the Massachusetts Health Data Consortium (MHDC). MHDC served as an incubator to create numerous multi-stakeholder initiatives, e.g., the New England Health Care Electronic Data Exchange Initiative (NEHEN) created in 1997 to enable compliance with HIPAA for administrative transactions, security and privacy; and the establishment of Simplifying Healthcare Among Regional Entities (MA-SHARE) in 2004.  These and other projects have placed Massachusetts in a leadership position in both health care policy and HIT. Full interoperability with Medicaid, MDPH and other State agencies is also anticipated for the State-wide HIE. The HIE Strategic and Operational Plan recently approved by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) builds on the state HIT Strategic Plan by providing a detailed road map for the deployment of statewide HIE services.  Under this plan, MeHI staff will operate a Program Management Office to oversee and support ?Last Mile? integration between the State-wide HIE deployed by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services. Guided by MeHI and EOHHS, a broad set of industry leaders and key stakeholders have participated in developing and will refine the strategy for and direction of the state-wide HIE services.  Once operational, the State-wide HIE for Massachusetts will help ensure that the Commonwealth will realize the goal of ensuring the quality, efficiency and safety of health care to all of its residents. In addition to the core HIE funds, supplemental funds were received to provide the seamless transfer of clinical information for patients who are transitioning from an acute care facility to a long-term facility as well as to support public health agencies in the collection of clinical and epidemiological data through a secure network.

Service-based companies such as call centers have shown interest in locating within the exchange boundaries, but the lack of a high-speed broadband infrastructure is often a deterrent to attracting new business to the area.  Educators and county service agencies stress the need for high-speed broadband services to address travel cost reductions and aid in the expansion of distance learning thorughout the three major counties erved.  Medical clinics are requesting high-speed broadband service to allow the clinics and medical service providers to improve the health care of the citizens.  In some cases the availability of high-speed broadband connections can literally mean the difference between life and death when treating patiens in these remote regions for critical donditions such as strokes and heart attacks.  * BROADBAND SERVICES - COMPETITIVE COST, STATE-OF-THE-ART SERVICE*  HTC plans to offer a range of affordable high-speed broadband plans for residential and business customers.  The plans will support three speeds 6MB, 10MB and 20MB.  There are three new residential rates planned from $49.95, $87.95 and $125.95 with business rates from $69.96, $82.46 and $149.99 respectively.  HTC is committed to providing high-quality, cost-effective broadband solutions as well as assist those agencies and businesses who are socially and economically disadvantaged with lower-cost services options.  HTC will provide a twenty-five percent reduction in the business rates previously discused to these disadvantaged small businesses.  High-speed broadband servies are far more important than merely providing amethod to receive emails or obtain forms of entertainment.  High-speed broadband is quickly becoming the new electronic interstate highway, stimulating new forms of commerce, education and critical care services.  HTC plans to construct a FTTH network for all subscribers located within its exchange boundaries.  This high-speed broadbnd network design is based on a state-of-the-art GPON solution providing fiber optic cable provides a long-lasting solution to current and future broadband services producing transport speeds with a reliability that surpasses the best of copper-baed Internet transport solutions.  Capacity in the access network is capable of supporting broadband services speeds in the multiples of one-hundred megabits per second.  This non-conducting fiber optic network eliminates many of the weather-related problems and the metallic deterioration that occurs with copper-based networks.  Reliability is paramount to a sucessful broadband service launch and this fiber-based design ensures the network can be maintained in a cost-effective manner that is crucial to managing recurring maintenance expenses and keeping service costs affordable.  HTC's high-speed broadband network design considers one-hundred percent coverage for the 1,709 miles of network remaining to be constructed.

We plan to exploit three complementary catalytic technological platforms anticipated to play key roles in biorefineries and energy/chemical production: (1) Non-aqueous phase processing to produce fuels, with focus on the newly introduced (by one of us) catalytic fast pyrolysis process; (2) Aqueous phase processing to selectively produce chemicals, with reforming technologies and selective dehydration coupled with selective oxidation being two foci areas. (3) Direct conversion of biomass derivatives to electricity using novel direct carbon fuel cells (DCFCs).  This project is being phase-out this Spring. In order to overcome the scientific barriers arising from handling these feedstocks, three crosscutting research thrusts will be developed: (1) Multiscale modeling to handle the inherent complexity of the environment in which reactions take place. (2) Hierarchical multiscale materials that are hydrothermally stable, possess tunable porosity with bio-inspired functionality grafted, and minimize molecular traffic resistance while allowing shape selectivity.

This new development will serve underserved areas by creating an advanced network of multiple services.  With this network build out Crow Agency and Lodge Grass exchanges Project Telephone will be able to offer quality services at competitive prices in a variety of bundled packages for the customer.  2. Assist those most impacted by the recession— The need for this proposed project can be seen in the following information from the 2000 U.S. Census, that Crow Agency household median income $22,438 and Lodge Grass household median income $22,120 is lower than the Montana median household income of $33,024.  Also it reported that 42.9% of families in Crow Agency and 39.8% of families in Lodge Grass live below the poverty level, compared to 10.5% for the state as a whole.  The official unemployment rate in Crow Agency is 27.7% and 16.1% in Lodge Grass compared to the National average of 5.8%. This project will assist in providing this underserved area with the necessary tools to help increase job opportunities as a direct result of having high-speed Internet access, benefit from enhanced access to education and thus the ability to train or retrain for employment. 3. Provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science and health— This project will provide 100% fiber optic based network utilizing GPON equipment for broadband service connectivity to residential and business locations, a service that will far exceed the requirements set forth in the NOFA.  Also an active Ethernet service of up to 1Gbs will be available to other entities.  This project will support ITV for distant learning, teleconferencing and telemedicine applications.

Without high-speed access, economic investment is unlikely. New broadband infrastructure will open up the PFSA to new economic opportunity, which results in job creation. Due to the remote location and low-income demographics of the PFSA, the residents and small amount of businesses, struggle to meet the demands of an ever changing and broadband dependent society. By providing broadband access, rural businesses, anchor institutions and residents will have the abiltiy to utilize e-commerce, new forms of communicaitons and virtual careers that were previously unavailable. Introducing broadband will help subscribers climb out of the current economic struggles they have found themselves overwhelmed with. By implementing an all fiber solution, cost effectiveness is maximized do to the long-term life of fiber. When initiating its long-term plan to provide Fiber to the Home (FTTH) throughout its service area, Allband undertook a lenghty examination of the benefits and costs of such a deployment. While the initial capital cost of deploying FTTH is greater than fiber-to-the-node or fixed or mobile wireless infrasturcture, Allband concluded the advantages of FTTH were greater, making the FTTH deployment more cost-efficient in the long run. Frist, all-fiber networks have the greatest broadband performance capabilties, including the ability to be upgraded easily at lower-cost. Allband recognized that these braodband performance capabilities were important for the economic and social well-being of its subscribers, communities, and critical institutions.

The Center for Direct Catalytic Conversion of Biomass to Biofuels (C3Bio) vision is to develop technologies that maximize the energy and carbon efficiencies of biofuel production by the rational and synergistic design of both physical and chemical conversion processes and the biomass itself. We have three research goals: 1. Apply new catalytic transformations to biomimetic structures and lignocellulosic biomass variants, and identify highly efficient process pathways. 2. Achieve an atomic-to-macromolecular scale understanding of the interactions of catalysts with the chemical and physical structures of lignocellulosic biomass. 3. Engineer tailored biomass for highly efficient, direct catalytic conversion to liquid fuels and value-added products.   The long-range impact of success in our research mission will be to more than double the carbon captured into fuel from biomass over existing technologies, and expand the product range beyond ethanol to alkanes and new energy-rich aromatic liquid fuels and other value-added products that retain the current liquid fuel infrastructure. The C3Bio collaborative effort will realize the fundamental processes of making and breaking covalent and other bonds in biological materials and afford us control of material properties at the molecular scale. Our proposed research plan will reveal new ways to design lignocellulosic biomass tailored for its end-use in direct chemical catalytic pathways. To reach this energy frontier, we will integrate advances in nanotechnology, chemical engineering, materials science, molecular biology and high-resolution instrumentation to relate the molecular and nanoscale properties of biomass materials to their macroscopic behavior in catalytic bioprocessing. Our commitment to education and outreach will provide undergraduate and graduate training in bioenergy systems and advanced analytical tools to help develop a future bioenergy workforce, create platforms for public education on alternative energy at local, state, and national levels, and engage corporate partners for new technology deployment.","15,074,136",13961317,Center for Direct Catalytic Conversion of Biomass to Bioenergy (c3Bio). Project identification code: 2005000,"In previous modeling work from our Chemical Engineering research group, fast-hydropyrolysis, coupled with catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) has been identified as a viable sustainable route for production of liquid fuel from biomass with high carbon and process efficiencies. In this proof-of-concept, the team designed and constructed a lab-scale, high-pressure, continuous-flow, fast-hydropyrolysis and vapor-phase catalytic HDO reactor system, which was successfully tested with cellulose as a model biomass feedstock. A high-pressure biomass feeder was specially designed for the reactor system. The team addressed the challenging quantitative analysis of the complex liquid products by developing a liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (LC/MS) method with results showing that high pressures (up to 50 bar) of hydrogen do not play a significant role in cellulose fast-hydropyrolysis, without a catalyst. Testing of candidate HDO catalysts suggested that, along with increased hydrogen pressure, a balance of metal and acid functions is necessary for selective HDO. Other significant findings in this effort include: that candidate catalysts provide useful insights for balancing metal and acid functions for designing increasingly selective HDO catalysts; process conditions such as pressure and temperature greatly affect the product distribution; and immediate downstream vapor phase catalytic upgrading of fast-hydropyrolysis products is beneficial to avoid secondary reactions due to condensation of unstable products that form “bio-oil”. Based on this work, the team has now developed catalysts that have resulted in 100% deoxygenation to directly produce hydrocarbons from both cellulose and intact biomass at 100% conversion.

Project Identification Code: 2005000.,"16,000,000",14929192,Recovery Act: Redefining Photovoltaic Efficiency Through Molecule-Scale Control - EFRC,"Recent developments in solar cell technology based on new materials called 'perovskites' have demonstrated solar power conversion efficiency greater than 15%. This is extremely promising for a new and very simple solar cell design. In spite of these exciting new developments, scientists do not have a good understanding for the nature of these materials nor for the mechanisms leading to such high efficiencies.  Understanding of these devices requires an understanding of this optically-active material at the atomic level. This is a major challenge because the perovskite material has structure on a nanometer scale and this is integrated into a porous network of titanium dioxide – a material similar to sand. Normally, it is difficult to determine the structure of nanomaterials since they are not subject to the techniques of x-ray crystallography. This quarter, the Columbia Energy Frontier Research Center has reported the first fully quantitative structural characterization of this perovskite material using a special technique called 'atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis' based on special high energy X-ray diffraction data. Our pair analysis revealed two distinct nanostructure components: one component representing 30% of the material which shows with medium range crystalline order and a second component comprising the remaining 70% which shows only local structural coherence – over distance of only a few molecules.  This unique structure on the nanometer scale correlates with increased electronic excitation as demonstrated through increased light emission or luminescence. Our findings suggest that these disordered structures, which are not visible in conventional measurements, are important to solar cell device efficiency, and will thus depend on the processing method. These results underscore the importance of characterizing and controlling the molecular order in these devices.

The Irvine Smart Grid Demonstration (ISGD) project will test the interoperability of key elements of the grid, from the transmission level through the distribution system and into the home. SCE’s experience with Smart Grid technologies, gained through the Avanti distribution circuit (co-funded by DOE), synchrophasor development, and the Edison SmartConnectTM smart meter program, to name a few, provides an important foundation for this project. ISGD will be a deep vertical dive that tests multiple components of an end-to-end Smart Grid. Thus, the project will provide a living laboratory for simultaneously demonstrating and assessing the interoperability of, and interaction between, various Smart Grid technologies and systems. ISGD will be deployed in the City of Irvine, an ideal demonstration site typical of some heavily populated areas of Southern California in climate, topography, environmental concerns, and other public policy issues. Project Objectives ISGD will allow SCE, project participants, and the DOE to verify the viability of Smart Grid technologies and cyber security when deployed in an integrated framework. The project will also provide a means to quantify the costs and benefits of these technologies in terms of overall energy consumption, operational efficiencies, and societal and environmental benefits. Finally, ISGD will allow the project team to test and validate the applicability of demonstrated Smart Grid elements for the Southern California region and the nation as a whole. Project Description and Participants ISGD is a comprehensive demonstration that will span the electricity delivery system. The project will use phasor measurement technology to enable substation-level situational awareness. It will extend beyond the substation to evaluate the latest generation of distribution automation technologies, including Universal Remote Circuit Interrupters (URCI), looped 12 kV distribution circuit topology, advanced voltage sensing and control, and self-healing technologies. The project scope also includes customer homes, where it will demonstrate the integration, monitoring, control, and efficacy of the Home Area Network (HAN) and consumer devices such as energy management systems, smart appliances, energy storage, and photovoltaic solar panels. Demand Response events will use the HAN protocols being adopted by Advanced Metering Infrastructure programs such as Edison SmartConnect™. The project will assess the impact of device-specific Demand Response, as well as load management capabilities that are coupled with energy storage devices. Tying these elements together is the Secure Energy Network (SENet), which will enable end-to-end interoperability with cyber security essential to Smart Grid development and adoption across the nation. The ISGD participants, led by SCE, consist of a combination of industry leaders, each of which brings essential expertise to the project. In addition to SCE, participants currently include General Electric (GE), University of California at Irvine (UCI), SunPower Corporation, University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute (USC ISI), Space-Time Insight (STI) and Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Expected Results This project will demonstrate a Smart Grid system that can be used as a platform to validate the coordinated use of NIST and NERC standards for future Smart Grid systems. Such standards include those governing systems integration, communications, cyber security, and interoperability.

Bennett Johnston Health and Environmental Research Building (JBJ building) on our Health Science Center campus. The main objective of this remodeling is to create open collaborative spaces that foster interdisciplinary research. The proposed remodeling encompasses 2,876 m2 (31,915 sq. ft.) on three floor of a building that was built fifteen years ago with very traditional, discipline oriented laboratories and offices. Tulane University is committed to remaining a top-tier research institution known for high quality, cutting-edge, basic and translational research. The proposed changes will provide modern, open laboratories that promote collaborative interactions between investigators, and support areas for each suite that include equipment rooms, tissue culture rooms, and meeting areas (Team rooms). Each suite is located adjacent to other investigators in the same research field to facilitate interaction and use of core equipment. In addition, we will upgrade the fa¿ade of the building to improve ambient lighting in the laboratory areas and improve the overall comfort in the work environment, thereby increasing productivity while realizing cost savings in electrical lighting. The project team will pursue a rating of LEED Silver for this project. The proposed remodeling reflects a change in the research culture at Tulane University by providing a means for looking beyond traditional discipline boundaries, recognizing opportunities across a broader landscape, and promoting interdisciplinary and translational research in areas where we have historic and current strengths - Infectious Diseases, Cardiovascular Disease - Renal - Hypertension, and Cancer.

The Calera Corporation process converts carbon dioxide (CO2) from the burning of fossil fuel into carbon-negative materials and water. The process also captures other emissions, including sulfur dioxide, acid gases, particulate matter, mercury, and other metals. The outputs of the process are clean air and materials that can be sold as aggregate,  supplementary cementicious materials (SCM) or commercial feedstocks. Calera's carbon-negative aggregate can be used in building applications such as concrete and asphalt. Furthermore when the SCM is used to replace a portion of the Portland cement in concrete, the resulting product has a smaller carbon footprint. Other carbon negative materials can also be produced.","20,959,689",20959689,Carbon Mineralization by Aqueous Precipitation for Beneficial Use of CO2 from Flue Gas,"In 2013 Qtr 4, design work for the integrated CO2 to Materials Product pilot demonstration plant has been completed and the specification and construction phase activities have been initiated.  Significant progress has been made with respect to equipment specification for the continuous fiber cement board production pilot subsystem, testing on gas and coal flue gas at pilot scale, utilization of carbide residue as an alternative calcium source, and on formulation development and prototype product testing using reactive carbonate cement produced from captured CO2.    A large batch of reactive carbonate cement has been produced which will be used to develop fiber cement board formulations and in early test work on the fiber cement board production line. Calera is focused on making fiber cement board with similar flexural strength properties to commercially available products but at lower densities.  All equipment for the fiber cement  board production equipment has been specified and with the approval to move to construction phase, the procurement process has been initiated for long lead items.    In the integrated production plant, the electrochemical and catalysis ABLE-M subsystems have been built and commissioned and extensive testing has been undertaken to optimize the equipment for final equipment specification and procurement.    Testing on the electrochemical single cell prototype has demonstrated similar performance to lab scale results providing key scale-up and optimized design information.  Extensive testing of the catalysis reactor and separation subsystems has been undertaken this quarter demonstrating the ability to produce the target products and to recycle reagents.

As part of Purdue's statewide Extension Program, the proposed Indiana Health Information Technology Extension center (I-HITEC) is well positioned to immediately begin achieving its two-year target of assisting 2,200 providers achieve the current and future Meaningful Use criteria. I-HITEC's mission is: To advance the adoption and Meaningful Use of electronic health records among Indiana primary care providers, with an emphasis upon serving small-group practices or practices that treat rural, uninsured, underinsured, underserved or other at-risk populations. I-HITEC already has an experienced staff, statewide presence, and commitment from 281 healthcare providers and three vendors interested in working with I-HITEC to achieve Meaningful Use. In addition, I-HITEC has 10 committed partners, including: (i) Health Care Excel, which fulfilled a CMS contract to successfully move 30 practices to full implementation of an EHR system; (ii) the Lugar Center for Rural Health, which is dedicated to advancing rural health and has 300 providers on paperless systems; and (iii) Ivy Tech Community College, which is a 23-campus statewide system with more than 11,500 students pursuing a healthcare-related major. I-HITEC's partners will help expedite Indiana's EHR adoption as well as help educate future EHR users, ensuring Indiana can continue adapting to the evolving criteria of Meaningful Use. I-HITEC will strive to become a national model for accelerating the adoption of certified EHR and achieving Meaningful Use by building upon three integrated approaches. First, I-HITEC will utilize a needs-based, algorithm-driven assistance model that customizes I-HITEC's services to directly meet the unique needs of each provider. Second, I-HITEC will promote each practice's long-term use of its EHR by providing 'side-by-side' service that educates the provider and/or staff during the workflow redesign and implementation process. Third, I-HITEC will simultaneously enhance its own financial sustainability as well as each practice's EHR sustainability by offering a paid service called the 'One Stop IT Shop,' which will enable practices to focus upon patient care rather than EHR concerns. The impact of these integrated efforts will be consistently measured by an evaluation tool developed by the I-HITEC team, enabling I-HITEC to adapt as needed. This strategy ensures Indiana medical providers will have the long-term support they need to successfully select, implement, and meaningfully use certified EHR. By 2012, more than 2,200 Indiana providers will be empowered to improve the quality of patient care and help the state become a recognized leader in transforming the nation's use of certified EHR.

With impacts ranging from industrial automation to household chores, robots are poised to become an integral part of modern life. Technological progress over the past several decades has laid the foundation for a new class of coordinated ?ying robots that draw inspiration from the biology, neuroethology, and morphology of a bee colony. This project will develop an autonomous colony of robotic bees, ?RoboBees?, and the proposed effort draws inspiration from natural bees through the development of three underlying pieces?the ?body?, ?brain?, and ?colony?. Bees exemplify the amazing wonders of nature in terms of their individual capabilities and how the collective behavior of a colony can achieve impossibly complex tasks in real-world environments. One motivating example is the task of pollination, which serves as a unifying framework to tie the design of the RoboBee colony together towards a single challenge application, but the full scope of relevant applications for a colony of autonomous ?ying robots is only limited by one?s imagination. Bees serve as an easy to understand, tangible, and accessible demonstration vehicle to clearly guide research objectives and broad educational goals. The structure and function of bees both motivate and guide the research goals of this project which are organized into the categories of body, brain, and colony. Topics for the body will include a multi-pronged approach to understanding the ?ight dynamics for agile ?apping-wing vehicles, design and analysis of the ?ight apparatus, and the development of compact, high energy density power sources and drive electronics. Research on the brain will include creation of a suite of proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors, the hardware that will make up the electronic nervous system, and control techniques for both ?ight stabilization and simple decision making. Finally, colony-level research will entail development of coordination algorithms, communication methods, and global-to-local programming tools. The focus on RoboBees will drive research in a large number of diverse areas from neurobiology and computer science to microelectronics and robotics. Because of the diverse expertise of the team and the requisite daily collaboration, the end products of this research will have far greater impact than the sum of the parts. This program will serve as a model of an ambitious goal which can only be solved by a team of experts in traditionally disparate ?elds.","9,301,955",8540512,"Collaborative Research: RoboBees: A Convergence of Body, Brain and Colony","Work on the RoboBees project is split into four topics: 'body', 'brain', 'colony', and our educational and outreach activities.

In the past quarter, we have continued the development of the flight controller as well as began the design of the final-scale robot that will house all components (propulsion, actuation, power, sensing, and control). Within the ?brain? team we are characterizing various sensors - both custom and commercially available - and developing the physical and electrical interfaces to the body and brain chip. In preparation for the final brain chip design, we are finalizing hardware accelerators to perform the central functions of the brain including image processing and flight control. Within the ?colony? we continue to evaluate various programming and coordination strategies in simulation, with small numbers using the helicopter testbed, and with large numbers using a colony of hundreds of simple, small ground robots.

As the Police Department downsizes and faces a significant reduction in sworn staff, the City of Stockton is using support from the COPS Office to help maintain community partnerships; most notably with the five local school districts, Downtown Business Alliance, Neighborhood Betterment Committees, and allied government agencies and task forces; dedicating Officers to specific community policing activities to develop solutions and increase trust and cooperation with participants.  With CHRP and other staff, the Police Department engages in a generalist approach to community policing by incorporating sound problem solving practices into routine Patrol assignments rather than relying on a few “specialist” problem solvers.  All Officers are encouraged to go beyond traditional Police responses and commit to problem solving and identifying conditions that contribute to crime and neighborhood disorder.  Responses are tailored in concert with community members to effectively reduce or eliminate crime problems.  The Police Department recognizes the continued economic crisis as an opportunity to reorient, restructure, and reengage in community policing and problem solving activities using the best practices that have evolved nationally over the past 20 years.  Organizational transformation occurs as the Department moves forward (with fewer managers, mid-managers, and line staff), reexamines the mission statement and strategic plan, and institutionalizes the practice of community policing agency-wide by using a broad range of community resources involving both public and private partnerships.  A more enlightened, empowered, and emancipated citizenry will emerge embracing the community policing philosophy of a personalized partnership with Police.",Completed,20 Police Officers who were scheduled for layoff prior to application approval were rehired as part of this grant.

A unifying objective of the synthetic strategy is to provide a range of polymer and nanocomposite materials geared towards morphological and photovoltaic device studies undertaken in ERGs 2 and 3.  Synthetic efforts will anticipate features of self-assembly, morphology, processibility, and charge transport, providing EFRC researchers with materials that contain tunable photophysical features, and that lead to efficient photovoltaic devices. The primary research thrusts of ERG 1 fall into two main areas. The first is the synthesis of conjugated homopolymers, block copolymers, segmented structures and materials with well-defined structural architectures, with control over component energy levels using electron withdrawing and donating functionality. The second is the preparation of p-type conjugated polymers with end-groups suitable for functionalization of n-type nanoparticles and nanorods, leading to effective dispersion of the particles and rods, and the preparation of hierarchically oriented nanomaterial assemblies for devices. ERG 2 The design and fabrication of a high-efficiency photovoltaic device requires precise control over the nanoscale morphology, molecular ordering, and interfacial properties of all components comprising the device.  While obvious in statement, in practice, these tasks are quite challenging; most research on polymer-based photovoltaic devices to date has systematically considered at most one of these details.  Researchers in ERG 2 integrate expertise in the synthesis, theory and engineering of polymers with established track records in controlling the self-assembly of polymers and the manipulation of polymer morphologies and individual chains in thin films.  This expertise will be used to develop routes to control the morphology and structure of polymer-based and polymer/inorganic-based hybrid photovoltaic devices so as to optimize efficiency.  The knowledge gained from these studies will then be used for device fabrication. ERG 3 In an organic solar cell, the conversion of light energy to electric current involves five fundamental processes, (1) the absorption of light to create excitons, (2) the diffusion of excitons to a region of high electric potential mismatch where charge separation can occur, (3) charge separation, (4) charge transport of the holes and electrons to their respective electrodes, and (5) transport of the carriers across the respective organic-electrode interfaces . All of these processes have to be understood individually to be able to optimize them for high efficiency solar cells. Detrimental effects, including charge carrier recombination and trapping, also need to be assessed to build structures that inhibit these effects. Associated with many of those processes are characteristic times scales that can be extremely fast (down to femtoseconds), particularly in nanoscale systems like the ones proposed in ERG 1 and ERG 2, since the distances involved are so small. Using time-resolved optical techniques it is possible to distinguish and quantify exciton lifetimes, charge separation dynamics, and electron and hole lifetimes that affect processes. The primary goal of ERG 3 will be to elucidate photophysical details of charge and energy transport within nanostructured PV composite films.  Single-molecule spectroscopy and ultrafast spectroscopy will provide valuable mechanistic insight and feedback to the synthetic components of our center as to the role of molecular architecture and confinement geometry on primary processes in PV systems.  Using this information, ERG 3 will also provide working PV cell characterization using device absorption and efficiency measurements.","16,000,000",13958025,Polymer-Based Materials for Harvesting Solar Energy,"Logistics: Russell has begun a Visiting Faculty position at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and has designed experiments to perform Fluctuation X-ray scattering studies on hole-conducting materials as they aggregate in solution.

The LASER Model is a system used by districts and schools to establish and sustain effective science education programs for all students. To establish the LASER Model in each of the three regional sites, the NSRC will work with its partners to introduce comprehensive, inquiry-based instructional programs for approximately 75,000 students and 3,000 teachers in grades one through eight.  Implementation strategies based on research and best practices include (1) providing a program of 24 eight-week instructional units for students and teachers in grades one through eight; (2) delivering a comprehensive program of professional development for teachers; (3) establishing professional learning communities; (4) establishing a cost-effective system to provide equipment and supplies; (5) developing effective assessment strategies for improving learning and teaching; and (6) establishing administrative and community support systems and networks to sustain this work. Moreover, the implementation of the NSRC model is supported by regional needs assessments, the development of a shared vision for effective science learning and teaching, and the completion of five-year strategic plans to establish a sustainable infrastructure for schools and districts in each of the three regions.  Institutional innovations such as these, which are aligned to district and regional education policies and regulations, support continuous improvement and renewal of leadership and provide long-term technical assistance to ensure all students benefit from a quality science education program. To assess the impact of the LASER model, researchers at the Center for Research in Educational Policy (CREP), University of Memphis, in partnership with researchers at local sites, have introduced a mixed method design for evaluation, combining a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with multiple case studies. The RCT will involve matched pairs of approximately 100 schools, with half randomly assigned to receive the LASER intervention beginning in the academic year 2011; the other half beginning in 2014. The CREP researchers will study science learning and teaching in both sets of schools, measuring the changing status of science education and the degree to which LASER is implemented with fidelity. They will track student learning outcomes using a combination of multiple-choice, open-ended, and performance items. Combining RCT data sets with qualitative data from case studies, including interviews with key informants at participating sites, researchers will create rich contextualized pictures of science education in selected schools and districts. These implementation data, combined with the student assessment data, test a central research hypothesis—where the model is implemented with fidelity, students in LASER schools will achieve at a higher level than their counterparts in non-LASER schools.

The major barrier currently impeding the wide spread use of photovoltaic energy conversion and solid state lighting is the cost of the technologies. Although the conversion efficiency of both technologies can be improved further, an order of magnitude cost reduction is needed in both technologies to enable competitive implementation against incumbent technologies. The proposed center has as its goals to demonstrate new technologies based on emerging nanostructure and organic materials that will enable photovoltaic energy conversation to become a significant portion of the world’s electricity infrastructure and solid state light emitting devices to become the dominant lighting technology in the world. To accomplish this, we will develop materials and devices that will lead to photovoltaic efficiencies exceeding 50% in optimized cells that can be manufactured on large scale and produce electricity at a cost competitive with current power plants. Similarly, we envision a white LED technology that produces a luminous efficiency exceeding 200 lumens per watt at the cost of common fluorescent and compact fluorescent sources, with comparable output. These breakthroughs will be achieved by exploiting the new degrees of freedom in design and fabrication technology that can be achieved by the manipulation of materials properties at the atomic scale that is inherent in the materials systems we will study. The Energy Frontier Research Center in emerging materials for solar energy and solid state lighting has as its goals the invention of new solar cell and LED designs based on nanostructured and organic materials. An interdisciplinary team from four major research Universities with expertise in nanostructure synthesis, organic molecule and polymer design and synthesis, optical and transport characterization of nanostructures, and device physics, fabrication and characterization will undertake fundamental studies to develop a broad understanding of the relationship between materials structure and the ultimate device performance. From this understanding new device designs will emerge that capitalize on our ability to engineer the materials at the atomic scale in these materials systems. Because both nanostructured semiconductors and organic materials can be synthesized by low energy processes, we expect that the resultant device concepts can be assembled on low cost media for eventual cost effective implementation. The development of cost effective processes is not part of the activities of the center, but we are mindful of the eventual cost goals of the applications. The outcome of our research will be the solar cell and LED designs that exhibit the desired performance goals.  The objectives of the Center research during the first five years will be to develop the fundamental control at the atomic scale, the understanding of materials properties and processes at that level to permit the rational design of solar cells and LEDs based on these novel materials, the understanding of interface and structural characteristics that control device performance, and the path to the fabrication of devices that demonstrate performance comparable to current technology.","12,500,000",10624264,EFRC-Emerging Materials for Solar Energy Conversion and Solid State Lighting,"ADMINISTRATIVE The  Center for Energy Nanoscience (CEN) has completed it first fifty one months of operation.

A subcontract with Community Care Network of Virginia (CCNV) extends VHITREC's capability to serve certain safety net providers and recruit priority providers. More than 20 healthcare stakeholder organizations indicated their support for VHITREC, which Virginia's Medicaid Director designated as an HIT adoption entity. The original application was accompanied by more than 600 commitments from priority providers. VHITREC has met its goal to sign-up 2,285 primary care providers in the program and help them to meaningfully use an EHR, as well as the goal to get 2285 providers to go-live. This represents nearly 50% of the Commonwealth's priority primary care providers. Building on VHQC's expertise as a national leader of the Medicare QIO Program's EHR initiatives with primary care physicians and CCNV's expertise as one of the first FQHC networks in the nation to implement EHRs, VHITREC delivers intensive, on-site technical assistance to priority providers. Working with VHITREC, providers assess their readiness for implementation, select EHR systems that match their practice needs, analyze workflows, and apply methodologies including Lean and Six Sigma to streamline patient care processes for efficient and meaningful EHR use. CIT provides support for interoperability, health information exchange, and EHR vendor management. EHR-specific communities of practice further accelerate adoption and meaningful use by creating a forum for peer-to-peer learning. In addition, all Virginia providers are able to access VHITREC educational resources, such as statewide webinars that foster sharing of best practices, and a website with information, self-training materials and tools. VHITREC will become a sustainable organization that can generate 100% of its income after the initial program ends in February 2014. After the grants period of performance, VHITREC will use lessons learned to not only assist the remainder of Virginia's priority primary care providers in becoming meaningful users of EHRs, but also to recruit a greater number of non-priority providers. VHITREC plans to be sustainable while advancing health quality by developing additional services tied to meaningful use and successful participation in pay-for-performance programs and patient centered medical home certifications.

EarthScope data will be openly available to maximize participation from the national and international scientific community and to provide ongoing educational outreach to students and the public. The intellectual merit of the EarthScope Facility is derived from its link to the support of fundamental research throughout the earth sciences. Through an ambitious data collection scheme and broad geographic coverage, the EarthScope Facility provides the observational resources to encourage cross-disciplinary investigations and stimulate the next generation of research scientists. The design and implementation plan for EarthScope was developed through extensive, decade-long engagement with the scientific and educational communities. Through numerous workshops and working groups, the research community, along with federal and state partners, defined the data and tools required for geoscience to take the next step in exploring the fundamental processes that shape the structure and evolution of our continents. Exciting results are already emerging from the analysis of new EarthScope data, confirming the enhanced resolution provided by this powerful new suite of observational tools. The broader impacts of EarthScope will be achieved through an integrated education and outreach program and applications in hazard assessment, land use, and resource management. While EarthScope is a national program, it is being operated and maintained at local levels through interactions with hundreds of universities, schools, and organizations across the nation. As EarthScope collects data and makes it available, students and the public will be introduced to key unanswered scientific questions and the role that their region or discipline plays in understanding the evolution of the North American continent and the active processes driving deformation and volcanic activity. Improved understanding of the natural environment is the first step toward improved land use, environmentally sound development, and resiliency to natural hazards.

34533,Office of Science,8925,Office of Science,89-0227,,2013,4,null,Grant,7/31/2009,"We propose the creation of an Energy Frontiers Research Center that brings together 19 senior scientists from seven universities (University of Notre Dame, University of Michigan, University of California at Davis, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Auburn University, George Washington University, Texas A&M University) and three national laboratories (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, Savannah River National Laboratory) to conduct transformative research in the solid-state actinide sciences. Experimental and computational approaches will be fully integrated, and the center will emphasize research questions that are important to the energy future of the nation. Workforce development will be a major emphasis of this university-based center.Research will focus on actinide-based materials, especially those with nanoscale and otherwise complex structures, and the properties of these materials in extreme environments. The research program includes extensive synthesis of actinide materials that are likely to lead to revolutionary new forms of matter with tailored properties. The self-radiation in such materials results in conditions far from equilibrium; thus, the effects of radiation are emphasized in this program. The nanoscale assembly of actinides into new materials has the potential to create new technologies, and will build upon our considerable success in this area. Research will be in three theme areas: (1) Complex actinide materials, (2) Nanoscale actinide materials, and (3) Actinide materials under extreme environments. Cross-cutting research themes that integrate the program are (1) Actinide behavior at the nanoscale, (2) Thermochemistry of actinide materials, (3) Synthesis of new types of actinide materials, and (4) Modeling of actinide materials. Research will focus on actinide-based materials with potential applications in nuclear energy. These include fluorite-structure solid-solution series (with actinides, lanthanides and zirconium) as  potential fuel types and waste forms, apatite-structure materials for actinide immobilization, actinyl materials with complex structural topologies, nanoscale clusters of actinyl polyhedra with fullurene and other topologies for nanoscale control of chemical reactions of actinides, mesoporous uranium-based materials as potential nanocomposite waste forms, and inorganic ion exchangers for actinides. Planned studies of these materials include their thermodynamics, reactions with aqueous and other solutions, surface properties, and resistance to radiation damage under the combined extreme environments of radiation dose, pressure and temperature. The research makes extensive use of Department of Energy user facilities, including the Advanced Photon Source, the National Synchrotron Light Source, the Spallation Neutron Source, the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, and the IVEM-tandem Facility. The management plan for this center calls for a director (P.C. Burns) who will be advised by a Scientific Advisory Board of distinguished scholars from outside the center, an Institutional Advisory Board consisting of the vice presidents for research at UND, UM and UCD, an Executive Committee consisting of the co-investigators, and a Research Advisory Committee with members selected from the senior investigators of the center. The management structure is designed to facilitate emphasis on high-risk, high-reward fundamental research. The workforce development plan focuses on graduate students (22) and post-doctoral fellows (13 to 16), and includes research experiences for undergraduates. A major goal is to educate young scientists in and attract them to actinide science.","15,300,000",6350958,Materials Science of Actinides,We continue to work with UC Davis (Navrotsky) for direction on running the calorimeter.

The principle objectives of the project are to (i) Demonstrate conversion of natural gas to 1 MM scfd of synthesis gas in a skidded OTM integrated pilot scale system and (ii) Demonstrate OTM oxy-fuel combustion and heat transfer at high rates of fuel utilization in a developmental scale system.   Building on the success of work undertaken in DE-FC26-07NT-43088 to develop basic materials, single tube membrane structures and process integration strategies for oxy-fuel combustion, Praxair will develop a robust and reliable OTM module that will be the building block for commercial deployment of reactively driven ceramic membrane systems.  Praxair has completed the conceptual design of a developmental scale OTM integrated syngas reactor and process (see Fig. 1).  In the proposed project this developmental scale equipment and infrastructure shall be constructed by mid 2012 utilizing first generation OTM module technology developed and supplied by Praxair.  The developmental scale syngas unit highlighted in Fig. 1 is sized at nominally 160,000 scfd of syngas.   Through a strategic partnership with a global ceramic manufacturing corporation we will develop a 2nd generation OTM module.  This second generation OTM module technology will be the basis around which a skidded 1 MM scfd syngas pilot demonstration facility is demonstrated during 2014.  Engineering design of the OTM syngas reactor and associated balance of plant equipment will be a joint effort between Praxair and a second strategic partner with expertise in process equipment design. Building on the development of the syngas reactor, a development scale OTM Combustion unit that integrates heat transfer to a thermal load at high rates of fuel utilization will be demonstrated.  Work done under Phase 1 of the existing DOE award has shown that the reactively driven OTM devices are best suited to provide oxygen for complete combustion up to a fuel utilization of approximately 85%.  Beyond this point it is more cost effective to utilize conventionally produced oxygen.  This work will be conducted later in the project and utilize much of the infrastructure that was developed for the Syngas Reactor.  We anticipate the Combustion Reactor being added downstream of the Syngas Reactor to allow some fuel pretreatment prior to introduction to the combustion reactor.

This grant project enlists Connected Tennessee, a subsidiary of Connected Nation, as the designated entity to provide the State of Tennessee with broadband mapping as outlined in the July 1, 2009 Notice of Funds Availability (NOFA) from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Connected Tennessee, by employing industry-standard Geographic Information System (GIS) toolsets and experienced personnel, will deliver a comprehensive, granular map of existing broadband service. Connected Tennessee, in collaboration with Tennessee broadband providers, will update these maps on a routine basis, which will be accessible to the public via Connected Tennessee's interactive portal (www.connectedtn.org.)  The interactive portal will also present overlaying data relevant to policymakers, providers, and consumers alike, including household density, demographic and topographical information, and civil infrastructure data.  The map will be searchable by address and will depict geographical areas such as municipalities, cities, townships, political districts, and state and federal lands.    Connected Tennessee will also release and maintain a Census Block level map of available broadband service in the state.  The interactive map and associated downloadable database will detail the identification number of each Census Block in Tennessee, the total number of households per Block, and the number of households with available broadband service per Block.  This project was originally funded for broadband planning activities and two years of data collection. In September of 2010, this project was amended to extend the data collection activities for an additional three years and to identify and implement best practices.  Planning: Connected Tennessee will utilize the data gathered throughout the mapping process to coordinate planning efforts.   Specifically, Connected Tennessee will focus on three items: (1) the need for better supply-side and demand-side data to inform broadband planning discussions; (2) the need for a user-friendly analytical framework for decision-making; (3) the need for coordinated human resources to prepare and facilitate research-based, data-driven planning discussions among relevant state and local leaders, capture the collective recommendations and decisions of the state through the preparation and production of a strategic plan, and assist the state in the implementation of its strategic plan.  State Capacity Building: As Tennessee seeks to develop a more focused effort on technology-based economic development, Connected Tennessee, under the guidance of the state, will compile and maintain an inventory of industrial and business park broadband availability that will be made available to all economic developers in the state.    Technical Assistance: Working in partnership with specialists from the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, Connected Tennessee will offer direct technical assistance to the local technology planning teams that have completed their initial technology plans. Connected Tennessee will also provide cost modeling and infrastructure assessments for local communities and conduct state level surveys in the third and fifth years of the program and county level surveys in the fourth year.","4,479,620",4479620,"American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-SBI-Connected Tennessee, LLC","The Tennessee (TN) broadband maps were updated with data from the semi-annual mapping data submission to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The updated maps were uploaded to the program website and into the My ConnectView interactive mapping application.  A broadband availability analysis of the latest mapping data was also conducted and a press release issued. A key finding of the analysis showed 82 percent of Tennessee households now have access to broadband service of at least 100 megabits per second download speeds and 1.5 megabits per second upload speeds, an increase of 40.5 percentage points in just two years.  Findings from a survey of Tennessee businesses, measuring the impact broadband adoption has on commerce in the state, were released. A key finding of the survey data showed more than three fourths of businesses in Tennessee use broadband, leaving an estimated 31,000 businesses that are not connected.  A report on digital workforce skills was also released showing 71 percent of Tennessee businesses say it is important or very important for potential employees to have digital skills, while 40 percent of Tennessee businesses say it is difficult or very difficult to find employees with the necessary technical skills.  In an effort to identify local technology projects, 10 communities and 37 planning team members are currently involved in some stage of Connected community engagement program.  Staff created and sent three monthly e-Newsletters to subscribers and stakeholders providing updates on the progress to expand broadband access, adoption, and use. Representatives also presented at the National Black Caucus of State Legislators 37th Annual Conference in Memphis.

A State Broadband Office is to be opened this winter to aid in the coordination and communication necessary to support this expansion. The effort involves the comprehensive statewide mapping of broadband availability across both rural areas and urban cities twice a year for the next 4 years.  The mapping effort is being conducted by a team comprised of the Office of Administration, University of Missouri, CBG Communications, and GeoDecisions of St. Louis.  Currently over 80 providers are cooperating with the mapping project. As well, over 6500 community anchor institutions (such as schools, libraries, fire and police stations, hospitals, etc) are being surveyed to discover broadband access at these key points within communities. Current efforts in developing a web-mapping Missouri Broadband Portal are underway with an expected launch of the site in Spring 2011.  From this mapping, technology plans are being developed statewide within Missouri’s 19 regional planning councils to guide and map the path forward for development and implementation of broadband strategies to advance broadband demand and adoption, broadband service, and infrastructure availability within and among these regions. Technical and organizational support for this regional planning will come from the State of Missouri, the University of Missouri, as well as GeoDecisions and CBG Communications. A recently held Broadband Summit was the visioning, scoping, and kick-off for these regional technology planning teams. The Summit had over 300 in attendance.

Diabetes is a priority condition that occurs in all racial and ethnic groups but has a higher prevalence among racial and ethnic minority populations and the elderly. Persons with diabetes have a high risk of developing chronic non-healing DFUs that progress to lower-limb amputation, disability and loss of life. Implementation of effective evidence-based DFU treatment guidelines is inhibited by systemic problems with data presentation, clinical care coordination, and loss of continuity of care for patients who are treated by multiple providers in both in- and out-patient settings. The OWEMR is a web-based medical informatics tool that synthesizes data about complex wound problems from multiple sources, identifies information needed to make treatment decisions at the point of care, uses intelligent search features to identify patients who require emergency interventions, and provides evidence based clinical decision support. The OWEMR was an effective clinical intervention that improved patient outcomes and reduced DFU-related amputations at New York University Medical Center. This project addresses the goals of this RFA: to study an intervention that informs decision-making and improve patient outcomes in a priority condition - diabetes mellitus; to address an established evidence gap in guidelines for achieving effective treatment - the role of glycemic control in promoting DFU healing; and to evaluate designated priority populations - African and Hispanic Americans and elderly and disabled persons. Aim 1 is to conduct a randomized controlled multi-center clinical trial to measure the effectiveness of the OWEMR as an intervention tool to reduce DFU-related lower limb amputations. The 11 participating outpatient foot care centers across the country are either university-affiliated/community medical centers, or Veterans Administration/military healthcare centers. Sites in each of these two categories will be randomly designated as either test sites that will use the OWEMR, or control sites that will use conventional medical record review. All patients will receive the same standard of care. The primary analysis will be the effect of OWEMR use on DFU-related lower limb amputations. Secondary analyses will identify clinical parameters correlated with healing or amputation, and measure the impact of advanced age and race/ethnicity on wound closure and amputation in population subgroups. Aim 2 is to the comprehensive database generated by a multi-center trial of the OWEMR in Aim 1 to address an evidence gap in diabetes care by evaluating the effect of glycemic control, as measured by plasma HbA1c levels, on DFU-related lower limb amputations.

Search Institute has received a development grant to replicate and expand the Building Assets - Reducing Risks (BARR) Program. BARR is a promising strategy with a focus on the first year of high school with intentionality on high-needs students, student achievement and student growth. The goal of BARR is to increase student achievement for all first year high school students using asset building and improve school climate as the means for these changes. This will be achieved by meeting these objectives: reduce academic failure; increase student attendance; decrease disciplinary incidents; and decrease alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use. BARR has been implemented and evaluated and has demonstrated results in reducing risk behaviours (i.e. failures, illegal substance use, truancy) and increasing thriving behaviors. It is listed in the National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP). We will achieve the goal of turning around persisting low-performing schools through integrating student supports into the school model to address non-academic barriers to learning (Absolute Priority 4). BARR is in the process of expansion to include 10th - 12th grade students at the site at which it was developed  with innovations that support college access and success (Competative Priority 6) while replicating the initial BARR program at three other low performing schools across the nation including rural LEAs (Competetive Priority 8). We will be partnering with the highly recognized program, Admission Possible, to develop our college and career readiness components. BARR Implementation will impact 7500 students from 2010-2014.","4,999,711",2289021.8,The Building Assets - Reducing Risks Program: Replication and Expansion of an Effective Strategy to Turn Around Low-Achieving Schools,"We focused on sharing the progress of BARR, analyzing data and communicating our work. We conducted monthly PLC calls with site coordinators, bi-weekly Project Management Team calls and calls with Abt Associates.  We held the Fall Gathering for all sites in Sanford, ME in October.

All superintendents, principals, and coordinators from i3 sites as well as teaching and support staff represented the schools. The acting Commissioner of Maine, Rachelle Tome, presented on high school reform and the implications of BARR. The Mayor of Portland greeted us and the gathering was extremely well received. We presented BARR findings at the National Dropout Prevention Conference (NDP) in Atlanta, GA in November.  We focused our presentation on the importance of 9th grade student success to alleviate the drop out crisis. We conducted our site visit in Hemet High School in November. The Hemet staff worked with the Educational Technical Assistance (ETA) providers and the Director was able to meet with the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendents and the Principals. The Hemet District is pleased with the implementation and outcomes of the BARR model and hopes to implement the model in additional high schools in the district.

There is currently no such center at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (JHMI) and few, if any, nationally that are dedicated specifically to bringing new molecular imaging agents - of all modalities - to the clinic. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (JHMI) and elsewhere are continually uncovering new therapeutic targets, reagents and biomarkers for cancer, central nervous system disease, cardiovascular disease and other disorders. An efficient way by which to validate new markers and drugs in human subjects and hasten their clinical acceptance is by imaging, an inherently noninvasive and quantitative method that is being increasingly adopted by the pharmaceutical industry. There is no lack of promising molecular imaging probes in preclinical development at JHMI and elsewhere. However, clinical translation of even the most promising molecular imaging agents is an imposing task, requiring a transdisciplinary team and usually commercial input. Unfortunately, interested commercial parties are not readily available and the goals of such parties may diverge from the spirit of the original discovery. In addition to the many new probes and techniques discovered at JHMI, there is an emerging infrastructure to facilitate the mechanics of clinical translation - including provision of expert advice regarding protocol development and seeking FDA approval - such as the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and the Brain Science Institute. Nevertheless, it remains difficult to move new molecular imaging agents to the clinic - to undertake that critical Phase 0 (first-in-man) study. This application seeks to bridge that gap by providing renovations to a 4,156 square foot facility, formerly occupied by the NIDA imaging group, in the lower level of Building G at JHB. Requested are funds to provide a development lab, cGMP facilities, including the capability of formulating materials for immediate human administration, and an imaging suite, the cornerstone of which will be a dual modality PET scanner. Through a generous matching start-up package provided by the Departments of Radiology and Psychiatry, a realistic financial plan, a wide variety of projects ripe for translation and a team of dedicated individuals with key complementary skills, we anticipate that the TMIC will become a valuable university, regional and national resource.

Connected Texas, by employing industry-standard GIS toolsets and experienced personnel, is delivering a comprehensive, granular map of existing broadband service. Connected Texas, in collaboration with broadband providers, will update these maps on a routine basis to reflect real-time broadband availability. Maps will be accessible to the general public via an interactive portal located at www.connectedtx.org. The interactive portal will also present overlaying data relevant to policymakers, providers, and consumers alike, including household density and other demographic information, topographical information, and civil infrastructure data. The map will be address-searchable and will depict geographical areas such as municipalities, cities, townships, political districts, and state and federal lands.  This project was originally funded for broadband planning activities and two years of data collection. In September of 2010, this project was amended to extend data collection activities for an additional three years and to identify and implement best practices.  Planning: Connected Texas will conduct an ongoing market-based survey research effort to help TDA and the public at-large better understand technology use and barriers to broadband adoption among residents and businesses in Texas. The outcome of this process will be the development of data-driven analyses of the challenges and opportunities related to broadband deployment and adoption. The primary analytical tool for the program will be BroadbandStat, a GIS analytics solution developed jointly by Connected Nation and Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) to provide a next generation solution for broadband mapping and decision-making. In addition, the information gathered and analyzed through the planning program activities will be translated, in close collaboration with the TDA, into a strategic plan that will outline broadband challenges and establish objectives for advancing the broadband goals of the state.  State Broadband Capacity Building: This project will leverage the work of the established Texas Broadband Task Force; seek input from experts from governmental agencies, nonprofits and trade associations; and assess current programs and laws and regulations that can be used to overcome impediments to broadband growth and adoption.  Technical Assistance: This project will conduct local research in the second year of the program and state research in the fourth year, both regarding the barriers to broadband availability and adoption. Connected Texas will work with a university in the state to peer review the results and conclusions from this research before presenting it publicly.  Local Regional Technology Planning Teams: In coordination with the TDA State Broadband Coordinator and the Texas Broadband Task Force, Connected Texas will work with the Texas Councils of Governments (COGs) and establish approximately 29 planning teams at a regional or local level. The 24 COGs and local officials for the additional five planning teams will assist in selecting the regional champion. Each team will conduct regular meetings throughout the first two years of the project to establish benchmarks, goals, and a strategic plan. Both planning teams and the Texas Broadband Task Force will participate in annual statewide strategic planning meetings to share best practices and identify and resolve any new barriers or challenges.","8,026,000",8026000,"American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-SBI-Connected Nation, Inc.-Texas","The Texas broadband maps were updated with data from the semi-annual mapping data submission to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

This objective will be achieved by developing and demonstrating EREVs in real world conditions with customers in several diverse locations across the United States and installing, demonstrating and testing charging infrastructure.  The project will complete the development of the Chevrolet Volt and place the vehicle in the hands of consumers in diverse locations across the U.S.  The demonstration will leverage the unique telematics platform of OnStar, standard on all Chevrolet Volts, to capture the operating experience that will lead to better understanding of customer usage.  The project team includes utility partners that will install, demonstrate and test charging infrastructure located in home, workplace and public locations to understand installation issues, customer usage and interaction with the electric grid.  Development and demonstration of advanced technologies such as smart charging, fast charging and battery to grid interface will be completed.

","30,500,000",23780529,Strategy to Accelerate U.S. Transition to Electric Vehicles,"Vehicle Demonstration GM began collecting electric vehicle driving and charging information through OnStar in Fall 2010.  GM demonstrated that detailed information can be 1) collected from vehicles, 2) stored and processed at OnStar, and 3) communicated to Idaho National Laboratory (INL).  At present, all vehicles used for data collection have been transferred to utilities located throughout the U.S. and Canada.  Data collection will continue for 24 months, with results reported through INL.  Utilities have installed 240 volt charging stations to prove the vehicle to infrastructure interface.  Data from this activity will enable DOE and industry planning for increased consumer adoption of electric vehicles. Special Projects Smart charging is being developed via two methods: (1) OnStar will continue to demonstrate utility controlled charging of Volt vehicles in 2012, including Demand Response, and Time of Use; and (2) GM will develop software and hardware enabling interfacing between the Volt and home area networks via Smart Meters.  This will be demonstrated at several utilities in 2012 and 2013.  Fast Charging demonstration completed with utility participants in December 2013. GM is developing SAE standard hardware and communications to provide uniform service station charging for future electric vehicles from any manufacturer.  Demonstrations with utilities are planned in 2012 and 2013. Volt batteries are expected to have significant capacity at end of vehicle life. One possible secondary use is grid energy storage.  A test bench is being developed to demonstrate this bi-directional energy flow and the grid services it can provide.   Demonstration of the unit will occur in 2012 and 2013.

The proposed project will support translational research at Mount Sinai School of Medicine by fully renovating Ann- 23, to improve functionality of laboratories, lab support, and administrative space. The requested renovations will affect 18,621 net square feet (29,500 gross square feet) and increase active research space from the current 57% of the floor to 73%. The floor currently supports $3.2 million in active grants. Immediate benefits of the proposed renovations will include relocation of peers and collaborators to the floor bringing an additional $1 million in active grants (total $4.2 million). Based on MSSM's current research-density benchmarks, the lab space created by the proposed improvements can support a projected additional $0.5 million in future research funding. The specific aims for this project are: o Expand laboratory space to accommodate ongoing growth of the research enterprise. o Redistribute functions so that ratio of lab, support, and office areas is in line with current standards. o Consolidate multi-disciplined programs to contiguous open lab space to improve safety, communication, administration, and training. o Expand BSL2+ core facility. o Support other program expansion in backfill spaces. Ann-23 is currently home to more than 85 staff, including PIs, postdocs, research fellows, research coordinators, administrative and other support staff. After the proposed improvements administrative space will be relocated to other floors resulting in an additional 42 research staff (127 people total) working on the floor.

REACH will work with providers to improve the quality and value of care they deliver through adopting and meaningfully using health information technology (HIT), specifically electronic health records (EHR), with an emphasis in rural practice needs and small urban practices serving medically underserved patients and areas. Over 30% of Minnesotans and North Dakotans live in rural areas. A significant percentage of the population is uninsured, underinsured, and medically underserved. REACH will accelerate and expand the work KHA is already deeply engaged. The organizations have successful track records in HIT education, training, and technical assistance, on their own and in coordination with many other collaborators. Collectively, KHA has served thousands of providers and organizations in HIT, reflecting readiness to be a Regional Center. REACH's goals are to provide assistance to providers for implementation and meaningful use of EHRs, through broad participation of providers, industry, universities, and state governments. REACH will help meet national HIT Extension Center (HITRC) goals by providing technical assistance services and support to 5,100 priority primary care providers (PPCPs) over the next 4 years, with 3,600 PPCPs targeted in the first 2 years. KHA has letters of commitment from 4,628 providers representing 417 practices in Minnesota and North Dakota. KHA will lead and manage change, help providers utilize HIT as a tool for improved quality and performance, and provide education that can be operationalized. The service area will be served by field staff assigned to geographic areas within the region. They will provide individualized technical assistance to PPCPs in their area. PPCPs focused on similar HIT goals will participate in facilitated education groups to work together to learn, test tools, and develop a network of colleagues. Remaining unbiased, KHA will leverage EHR vendors to help address technical issues. KHA will disseminate to providers best practices and research. Existing online resources for HIT implementation and distance learning capabilities will be utilized. KHA will further embed HIT into practice by implementing a leadership training program for senior administrative and clinical leaders. Among other topics, technical assistance and education will cover provider readiness and leadership commitment, workflow redesign, EHR functionality, identifying and selecting a vendor, meaningful use, protecting privacy and security of patient information, developing vendor relationships, and preparing for and participating in health information exchange. Targeted providers are represented by a variety of associations and networks that have committed to work with KHA in this effort.

However, the GAMMA chargers are struggling.   There are 2 chargers; one operates at approximately 50% and the other at 80%.  Link does have three of the five trolleys, however they have been parked since Nov 1, due to the Nickel Cadmium batteries getting close to the end of their life and not being able to hold a complete charge, which causes the trolleys to stall out.    The Project Manager (PM) has resigned due to the grant funding running out.  He was a major support on a daily basis to help the GAMMA chargers to connect to the buses.  He was Ebuses main support on a daily basis.  Ebus is scheduled to deliver a trolley with Lithium Titinate batteries mid-January 2014, with the remainder to be delivered by mid-May 2015.

Over five years, we will work with Communities in Schools of North Carolina to implement, validate, and scale up an innovative approach to combating summer loss among low-income children. The Project—called READS (Reading Enhances Achievement During Summer)—provides children with books during the summer and promotes summer reading with teacher and parent “scaffolding.” In implementing READS, districts must adopt a set of data use strategies that inform decision-making and help to improve student achievement, such as examining spring to fall achievement gains or losses and using the results of student surveys and achievement tests to select books that are well matched to students' reading skills and interests. The major goal of the I3 grant is to validate the READS intervention in North Carolina through a series of randomized experiments involving seven districts and as many as 10,000 students. In the final year of the project, we will use data from the experiments to scale-up the most cost-effective version of the READS program. The proposed project has three phases: Phase 1 Validation, which includes testing READS in several districts including Durham Public Schools and an effort to increase the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the program; Phase 2 Validation, which involves expansion into more districts and many more schools and testing the cumulative impact of READS across summers; and Phase 3 Scale-Up, which involves expansion into as many as 20 more districts. In Phase 1 Validation, an independent evaluator will a) conduct two experiments that test the effects of the READS program that was implemented previously and an enhanced version of it, and b) analyze the cost effectiveness of the basic and enhanced versions of READS to identify the most cost effective version (CE READS). In phase 2 validation, the evaluator will (a) conduct an experimental test of the effects of the READS program in high poverty schools overall, and for a subgroup of students most likely to benefit in high poverty schools, and (b) compare growth over the summer and school year for students who receive READS for two summers vs. one summer. In Phase 3 Scale-Up, the non-profit partner CIS will scale up CE READS in up to 20 NC districts. High-quality implementation data will be collected in all three phases to ensure fidelity of implementation, understand how key stakeholders use data in making decisions about expansion, and understand how a non-profit organization like CIS can successfully facilitate scale-up of READS across districts. Project data will be used in the three ways to improve student achievement. First, project data will inform each version of the READS intervention. We will use data to match books to children’s reading level and interests, and we will use fidelity and performance data to develop lessons, teacher training, and family night event scripts in order to scaffold children’s summer reading through comprehension lessons at the end of the school year and over the summer. Second, project data will inform the READS evaluation. We will use data from randomized experiments to identify cost-effective innovations to core READS. We will estimate impacts on reading comprehension and generate per pupil costs of the various READS interventions. Third, project data will be used to inform district policy. We will share data from the READS evaluation studies with district stakeholders through interviews and focus groups and then use data from stakeholders to modify and enhance READS. We start by validating READS in one district, and then over three additional years of experimental trials, we systematically scale the intervention and evaluation strategy in seven districts.","12,773,136",9801539,Project READS: Using Data to Promote Summer Reading and Close the Achievement Gap for Low-SES Students in North Carolina,"PROGRAM CONTENT AND PLANNING: Revised and finalized year 4 training plans for teacher lessons and family night educators; completed 4th grade lessons; developed 4th grade teacher’s log; revised third grade lessons and finalized all lesson materials; revised Family Night event materials and all training materials.

This is accomplished by providing broadband service to community anchor institutions such as schools (K12), health care, public safety access points (PSAP), libraries, courthouses, law enforcement, and other community anchor organizations and agencies.  Further, this grant builds twelve (12) new towers, and 5 replacement towers, while improving over ninety-five additional towers facilitating wireless broadband connectivity. Coupled with the community anchor connectivity, the focus of the grant is to provide broadband service to un-served and under-served areas of West Virginia.  Benefits of the grant include: outreach, access, equipment (and related support), high speed internet access, and new or improved utilization of broadband services by the noted community anchors.  Additional benefits include, but are not limited to, greater use of high speed internet services by low-income, unemployed, aged, and otherwise vulnerable populations while stimulating the demand for broadband and fostering economic growth and job creation.  The keys to accomplishing the objective, focus, and goals are via utilization of microwave, multiprotocol label switching, and other technologies.    A minimum service of 10 mega bits per second will provide secure virtual private network access statewide and other high speed internet and video services.  Partnerships will ensure deployment of the network impacting the broadest range of users while developing a statewide logical, but open network.  Each of the noted community anchor identified applications will be provided either enhanced/improved or new service as the physical infrastructure is deployed.   The need for connectivity for the remaining K12  schools, hospitals, public safety access points (9-1-1 centers), libraries, courthouses, and correctional facilities identifies a significant level of need for expanded broadband in the state.

This infrastructure enables (not included in this grant) last mile connectivity to multiple un-served and under-served businesses and individuals throughout the state.  Although this grant does not provide actual connectivity, it facilitates connectivity of the various community anchor institutions with vendors of their choice.  Also, this grant provides significant over 40 strands of fiber at or near each of the community anchor institute termination points.  This effectively provides sufficient fiber for future community growth.  The high speed internet immediately provides access enabling connectivity to community anchor institutions such as schools, libraries, courthouses, 9-1-1 centers, medical offices, and jails.  Through this high speed internet access approach, using Multiprotocol Label Switching, towers with enhanced microwave connectivity, and other applications, many last mile customers will be offered broadband services.

The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to study the crystalline morphologies that naturally form (or can deliberately be formed) during the processing and manufacturing of semicrystalline polymer nanocomposites. These studies will in turn inform efforts to leverage nanoparticle-induced crystallization to directly address two pervasive issues related to the processing of these materials: 1) the ability to quantitatively assess the level of nanoparticle dispersion within the polymer, and 2) the ability to judiciously tailor the nanoparticle-polymer interface in a manner that does not inherently damage the structure, and hence degrade the properties, of the embedded nanoreinforcement. If successful, the results of this research will enable new approaches to address two far-reaching impediments to the manufacture and optimization of semicrystalline polymer nanocomposites, an emerging technology being widely pursued to impart enhanced multifunctional behavior and properties to this technologically important class of polymers. The proposed research program is coupled to an educational initiative that will develop, pilot, and disseminate pedagogically-inspired, simulation-based learning modules which utilize modern engineering software tools to assist undergraduate students in visualizing various fundamental concepts covered within the mechanical engineering curriculum. In pursuing the proposed research and educational efforts the PI will: 1) enthusiastically recruit and mentor undergraduate and graduate students working in these areas, 2) collaborate with local high school teachers and the Center for Innovation in Engineering and Science Education at Stevens to adapt related materials for use within the K-12 STEM curriculum, 3) actively participate in outreach programs to broaden the number of students exposed to engineering and nanotechnology, and 4) develop and strengthen national and international collaborations in these areas.

SNC's proposed funded service area (PFSA) is its entire certificated telephone company service territory as filed with the Nebraska Public Service Commission excluding the town of Falls City in which FTTH construction is already underway.  The PFSA includes the contiguous Nebraska telephone exchanges of Falls City and Tri City and contains the villages of Barada, Preston, Rulo, Salem, Shubert, Stella and Verdon as well as Other Areas in the Nebraska Counties of Nemaha and Richardson and Other Areas in a very small portion of Brown County in Kansas.

These LAF?s, therefore, become the prime production drilling target for development of commercial geothermal systems.  The problem often encountered is that LAF?s are sporadically distributed within the fault and fracture system constituting a typical geothermal reservoir.  Numerous examples of US commercial geothermal developments exist where a few highly productive wells that have encountered LAF?s supply the bulk of the geofluid to the power plant while production wells in the same field that do not encounter LAF?s are of marginal value  US Geothermal Inc. (USG) is proposing to develop an exploration strategy and suite of innovative techniques that will precisely locate Large Aperture Fractures (LAF?s) distributed within a faulted and fractured geothermal system.  USG will develop and test the combination of three-component long-offset active source seismic surveying, permanent scatter synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PSInSAR) and kinematic structural analysis as an integrated method for locating and 3-D mapping of LAF?s in shallow to intermediate depth (600-4000 feet) geothermal systems.  LAF?s are defined for this proposal to be open voids within hydrothermally active fracture systems that have apertures in excess of 0.5 foot (15 cm).  LAF?s are critical to the economic viability of many geothermal projects because wells drilled into LAF?s typically exhibit very high productivity and low pressure drawdown.  To date, no systematic approach for locating and mapping these specific features within geothermal prospects and fields have been developed.  Development and testing of this integrated methodology will lead to significantly reduced number of dry holes, fewer, more productive wells for a given wellfield power output and reduced parasitic loads for production well pumping.

Drill pipe became stuck when starting out of the hole.  Temperature surveys were run inside the drill pipe to a depth of 3620?.  Temperatures below the shallow thermal aquifer at 284? reversed and then assumed a nearly isothermal profile to total depth at a temperature of 175F.  The observed equilibrated temperature at TD was anomalously low, as much as 125F below the expected temperature.  This result indicates that the shallow thermal anomaly is due entirely to a shallow plume propagating from the south, outside of the US Geothermal leasehold.  There was no indication in the equilibrated profile that there was any permeability at depth that hosted fluids of commercial temperature (>280F). Based on the disappointing results from OW-12, US Geothermal, Inc. proposed to move all further exploration drilling activity to the southern extension of the operating San Emidio geothermal wellfield.  This area, to the south of OW-10 and east of 45A-21 contains proven temperatures in excess of 300F at target depths of less than 3000?.  Seven wells, OW-13 through OW-19 were sited in this area.

115033,National Institutes of Health,7529,National Institutes of Health,75-0842,,2013,4,1,Grant,9/16/2010,"Bacteria resistant to antibiotic therapy accounted for an estimated 94,000 life-threatening infections and over 18,500 deaths in 2005, more deaths than from AIDS that year (Klevens et al. 2007). Resistant bacterial strains have been linked to aggressive antibiotic prescribing. Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a high frequency primary care problem for which antibiotics prescriptions are often unwarranted. Standard attempts to influence physician behavior using economic incentives (i.e., pay-for-performance) have had limited success, are costly, and rarely persist after the intervention ends. Behavioral economics may improve treatment of ARIs in a sustained way by appealing to providers' self-image. First, we propose to study the impact of enhanced defaults, in which alternatives to antibiotics are the presumed course of action and use of antibiotics must be explicitly justified. Numerous studies have found that alternatives are much more popular when they are designated the default. Second, we will study social norms, in which we present health care providers with feedback on their own behavior, the behavior of a group of successful peers who rarely prescribe inappropriate antibiotics (descriptive norm), and the recommended guidelines (injunctive norm). Numerous studies have shown that people strive to conform to such norms. Finally, we will study providing salient alternatives to antibiotics in electronic health records, prompting providers to explicit state their preferences for them, and informing them of the (high) proportion of colleagues who also prefer them. We propose to apply these principles at the point-of-care in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial cluster randomized trial with 46 diverse clinical sites across the United States. Clinics will be randomized to education plus care provision with and without an enhanced default, social norm, and alternative prescribing interventions. The long-term objective is to develop a set of applied behavioral economic tools that are effective in prompting providers to adhere to guidelines in infection treatment, and which may have application in other areas of health care delivery. The success of this project will result in: 1) increased patient safety through a reduction in inappropriate and overuse of antibiotic therapies; and 2) more efficient and appropriate utilization of health care resources by reducing inappropriate and overuse of antibiotic therapies and decreasing the prevalence of medication resistant infections.","11,464,018",3878764,Use of Behavioral Economics to Improve Treatment of Acute Respiratory Infections,"OVERALL PURPOSE Bacteria resistant to antibiotic therapy are a major public health problem.  Annually, over 76 million primary care office visits for Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) result in 41 million antibiotic prescriptions, with an excess of 55% (22.6 million) of antibiotics prescribed to treat non-bacterial infections (Gonzales 2001).  The overall purpose of this award is to evaluate in a cluster randomized trial the effectiveness of three behavioral economic strategies to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing:  1) Enhanced default, 2) Social Norms and 3) Alternative Prescribing.

99789,Golden Field Office,89GO,Golden Field Office,89-0331,,2013,4,null,Grant,12/4/2009,"In June 2009, ICM, Inc. submitted a proposal to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to build and demonstrate at our ICM pilot plant on the St. Joseph, MO Lifeline Foods campus a 0.5MMGY pilot integrated biorefinery under a federal recovery act program administered by DOE?s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, CO. ICM submitted its proposal for the DE-FOA-0000096 ? Recovery Act - Demonstration of Integrated Biorefinery Operations. On December 4, 2009, ICM was notified by the DOE that its application has been selected for negotiations leading to a contract and award. The DOE award amount is $25 million, and based upon the government?s cost-share requirement, ICM will contribute more than $6 million of its own funds for the advanced biorefinery project.  Project Objective - ICM will pilot its proposed process to convert high-impact cellulosic feedstocks (switchgrass and energy ?forage? sorghum) and captive corn fiber in a process that will pretreat and enzymatically hydrolyze cellulose to C5 and C6 sugars. After this process is completed, the sugars will ferment into ethanol using a novel yeast; residual solids/lignin will be burned to provide heat and electricity to run the process. Project Description - As the technology provider and general contractor, ICM will construct, operate and validate an integrated cellulosic biorefinery. This biochemical platform will be enhanced by energy recycling and process flow innovations to refine cellulosic biomass at a rate of (10) tonnes/day into fuel ethanol with co-products of lignin/biomass for combined heat and power (CHP) production. ICM will test small scale production of cellulosic biomass feedstocks including switchgrass, energy sorghum, and corn fiber ? the fiber shell surrounding each corn kernel.   ICM recognizes the significance of further strengthening the capabilities of producing renewable fuel in U.S. corn-based ethanol plants. The proposed integrated cellulosic biorefinery will be co-located in St. Joseph, MO, on the LifeLine Foods campus. The facility will leverage ICM?s existing integrated starch pilot plant retrofitting it for cellulose processing. This project will demonstrate the capability of co-locating a cellulosic ethanol plant at an existing corn-based ethanol facility at pilot scale. This technology will provide the potential to increase a corn-based ethanol facility?s total renewable fuels capacity by also producing fuel-grade ethanol from non-food cellulose materials (previously referenced). The co-located cellulose pilot scale project will not impact Lifeline?s 50 million gallon per year production capacity of ethanol in its corn-based facility at St. Joseph, MO. Timeline - The project timeline is approximately five (5) years, once the contract is awarded. We expect to be engaged in contract negotiations with US DOE during the period of December 2009 - January   2010, and will not begin construction until the contract is officially awarded to us. ICM anticipates construction to take approximately one (1) year, with construction to actually commence at the earliest in May 2010 and will not affect regular ethanol production at the facility in St. Joseph. The remaining four (4) years of operation will focus on proving the ICM cellulose to ethanol process, with testing of each specific unit operation.  Once all unit operations have been proven, then ICM will prove the integrated process which is expected to be commercially viable.  During this time, ICM will prove the process using two high impact cellulosic feedstocks ? switchgrass and forage sorghum ? and captive corn fiber that can be isolated by dry fractionation of corn as is done at LifeLine Foods 50MMGY facility. When ICM successfully demonstrates at pilot scale commercially-viable cellulose to ethanol process, ICM then plans to commercially implement this ?second generation? ethanol process technology to those plants that are interested in a co-located cellulose operation.","25,000,000",24069605,Integrated cellulosic biorefinery for ethanol production,"In the 4th Quarter of 2013, ICM proceeded to prepare for a 1,000 hour performance campaign using energy sorghum as the feedstock.  We began preparations by conducting milling tests to determine the best particle size of feedstock to bring into the front end of the process.  This was done by milling the feedstock through various sized hammermill screens and then conducting mixing and pumping tests to determine handling characteristics.  As part of the process, we conducted pretreatment of these various material conditions.  As part of that effort, we encountered unusual wear issues in our steam jet valves.  We are looking at different materials of construction to solve this issue.  Following pretreatment of the energy sorghum we hydrolyzed and fermented material.  It converted very well in an unoptimized scenario.  We have also identified our solid/liquid separation as an opportunity for improvement.  We began conducting vendor tests to improve upon the rotary vacuum drum filter we are currently using.  Beginning in the 1st Quarter of 2014, we plan to conduct pretreatment optimization of energy sorghum first, and then begin these same tests on our second energy crop, switchgrass.",More than 50% Completed,"The jobs created this quarter were 4% Engineering, 5% Project Management, 14% Lab, 9% Scientists, 68% Operations.

A123 Systems and the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) are project participants. SCE, a subsidiary of Edison International (EIX), is an investor owned utility operating in the State of California, covering over 50,000 square miles and serving over 13 million people with an energy portfolio that includes 12.6 billion kWh of renewable energy. SCE has over twenty years experience in large scale wind generation integration and in the development and testing of battery technologies for grid applications. As such, SCE brings to the project comprehensive experience in all relevant technological and operational areas.  The objective of the project is to evaluate utility scale lithium-ion battery technology in improving grid performance and integrating wind generation. By executing the project, SCE will evaluate a wider range of applications for lithium-ion batteries that may spur broader demand for the technology, potentially bringing production to a scale that could make this form of large energy storage more affordable. Cost-effective energy storage will allow for a smarter grid, facilitate integration of intermittent renewable resources, and encourage job growth in the energy sector. In 2008, through a California Energy Commission (CEC) funded project, SCE, Quanta Technology and Oak Creek Energy began studying the potential benefits of using energy storage devices to address integration issues associated with intermittent renewable resources such as wind generation. Antelope-Bailey was one of three SCE sites chosen for the CEC study and it was selected due to the large number of wind farms installed there. The TSP team has selected the Antelope-Bailey 66kV system for this demonstration because using the same location will allow the team to leverage the results of the CEC study and maximize the benefits of this project. Antelope-Bailey is part of the Tehachapi Wind Resource Area (TWRA), where up to 4,500 MW of wind resources will come online by 2015. SCE’s service area is home to the state’s most productive sites for wind and solar generation including the TWRA. The effective cultivation of these resources – enabled in part by energy storage – will help SCE meet state Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) goals and establish replicable methods for broader national utilization. The TSP storage system will consist of an 8 MW – 4 hour (32 MWh) lithium-ion battery and inverter that are cutting-edge in scale and application. To demonstrate the system’s effectiveness in improving grid performance and wind integration, the team will test the battery under 13 specific operational uses derived from the Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI) energy storage market research. These targeted uses are in line with the DOE’s stated goals of refining utility load shifting, increasing dispatchability of wind generation, and enhancing ramp rate control to minimize fossil fuel-powered back-up generator operation. The project involves 24 months of study, data collection and analysis. The energy storage system applications will be evaluated under real-time and simulated operational scenarios. Project analysis is managed by SCE in collaboration with CAISO, leading energy engineering firms and research institutions. A Technology Advisory Council involving peers CAISO, Pacific Gas & Electric, Sempra Energy, and Idaho Power, along with the Utility Wind Integration Group will oversee performance testing and evaluate results. The TSP team will release regular reports detailing project progress and findings on the effectiveness of lithium-ion storage systems in mitigating transmission, distribution and other grid challenges.","24,978,264",5600051.36,Tehachapi Wind Energy Storage Project,"Some key dates and successes in Q4 2013 include:  • 10/10/2013 – 2 x 4.5 MVA Power Conversion Systems installed at Monolith Substation • 10/22/2013 – SCE received approval from NETL to utilize its security instruments as intended and to dispose of 3 test inverters   • 10/24/2013 – LG completed the installation of all equipment at site including battery racks, modules, site energy controllers, section controllers, disconnects and Power Conversion Systems  • 10/24/2013 – SCE presented a project update at the DOE Peer Review in San Diego on the Bonus Day • 11/04/2013 – The SCE TSP team met with internal stakeholders to discuss energization outages and reliability impacts • 11/06/2013 – SCE and LG conducted a meeting to review mini-system acceptance testing in Pomona   • 11/08/2013 – SCE conducted a job walk at Monolith to review and plan for the proposed changes to the Inverter Control Voltage Input design  • 11/16/2013 – SCE presented a project overview at the Taiwan-America Science and Technology Conference • 12/13/2013 – SCE received a report from LG indicating that fire suppression system testing at Monolith was complete • 12/18/2013 – LG submitted decommissioning and maintenance plans to SCE    • 12/20/2013 – SCE completed the initial safety tests for the mini-system in Pomona  • 12/30/2013 – SCE held a meeting with Quanta to discuss M&V data collection and reporting  ",Less Than 50% Completed,"Jobs were created to provide Project Management Support for the energy storage system and engineering support related to siting, construction, and substation and grid preparation.","2,181,507.77",11.45,8261002.23,17142412.62,0, ,CA,US,Tehachapi,35.13544,-118.45278,

Here, in the context of a Master?s course in information system design, we construct and test a series of exercises aimed at promoting innovative designs, inspired by thinking about creative processes in general and the information technology design process in particular. Information design is an ideal platform for the study and promotion of creative processes, because the topological structure of information systems allows development of tools for objective representation of the accuracy, variability, and similarity of designs. We develop three increasingly broad and sophisticated sets of exercises to be tested in design courses. The first set uses exploratory play with the elements of IT design (nodes and links) and priming of fundamental topological structures (trees and hubs) in order to elicit more advanced and creative solutions for initial design problems. The second set uses techniques that encourage abstraction to enable students to transfer designs across domains. The third set employs perceptual manipulation of design topology and conceptual comparisons of design topologies to increase the variability of design solutions students invent. The tool for representing and comparing designs will be turned into a tool for encouraging the generation of varied and novel designs. Because the experiments are embedded in a design course, the exercises will benefit both students and research. Intellectual Merit: Such an undertaking demands expertise in several disciplines, including psychology and information systems. Collectively, the team has expertise in human comprehension and production of diagrams, research design and evaluation of educational methods, and the design of software-intensive information systems. Although there are many methods recommended for teaching systems design, few of these have been empirically tested. The proposed research is novel in that it will look at the intermediate product of IT design, topological sketches, in order to understand the cognitive processes of creativity. From this, we construct methods to assess and to increase design innovation that will be useful to other researchers and instructors. The team bases its predictions and techniques on their current research on the development of design expertise in the classroom context; the team has already produced computational tools that serve as the foundation for the proposed research. The application of these techniques to systems design is novel, and has the potential to improve our understanding of creative processes in information technology. Broader Impact: Poor design, and the resulting poor software, impedes coordination in many government and corporate institutions. Improvements in the education of designers may be amplified by their efforts in practice and in mentoring other designers over the length of their careers. Specific impacts should include improving systems design education, consequently improving the efficacy of software and social systems created by graduates of this and other design programs. For this reason, possible impacts include better homeland security, better economic growth, better social services, and other effects of improved systems design. Thus, insights in this domain may help us improve a broad range of human activities. The research has the potential to be transformative, because design is the way we interact with the future.","762,072",382752,Generating Alternatives: Enhancing Creativity in the Design of Information Systems,"During the last quarter of the project, one month was worked, as the project ended June 30.

This program develops, implements, and evaluates a rigorous grade 9-12 STEM Academy model with strong potential to increase high-need student STEM interest and achievement. To foster STEM21participation, middle school students will be engaged in STEM preparatory programs.       Promising evidence of model efficacy to date includes curriculum testing in diverse settings (1,200 students; >40% minority); sustained collaboration among students, educators, and STEM professionals; statistically significant increases in student STEM content knowledge/career interest; and CSDE endorsement of the science sequence as a model for 21st century high school redesign. Courses will be developed collaboratively by teams of teachers, college faculty, and STEM industry leaders; integrate 21st century standards; and be delivered in a ?blended? learning environment, engaging students in a progression of interactive online coursework guided by teachers in classrooms and augmented by experiential learning. Intensive professional development will be provided to advance teacher content knowledge and instructional skills. Formative, interim, and summative assessments will be fully integrated.      National and state assessments indicate that most CT graduates are unprepared for college and STEM careers. Achievement gaps between poor and non-poor and minority and non-minority students are most acute at the high school level where non-poor white students score higher across all subject areas.[1] STEM21 seeks to close these gaps by implementing a progressive, four-year science, mathematics, and technology course sequence. The guiding hypothesis is: If students fully participate in the STEM21 Academy, then they will demonstrate improved academic achievement, interest in, and readiness for college-level STEM coursework.      Expected outcomes include the full development, high fidelity implementation, and evaluation of the 4-year STEM21 Academy model in 12 high schools, impacting over 960 students (>50% high-need). Middle school programs will reach an additional 1,000 students. Future model replication in the 168 high schools across the state (176,534 students) can be accomplished.

The ensuing deliverables will include datasets as required by the NTIA as well as web-based, interactive broadband maps to inform state and local government officials, consumers, broadband providers, community development organizations, researchers and other stakeholders. This interactive website will be critical to ensure accessibility of the broadband data, but it will also be key to increasing awareness of the mapping program and the benefit of broadband. It will also play an important role in ensuring local verification of the mapping data. Data will be compiled directly from network providers with protection to the proprietary aspects of that data provided by non-disclosure agreements. The Partnership for a Connected Illinois will receive datasets from individual providers, develop comprehensive datasets of Illinois providers of all platforms, excluding satellite, then incorporating those datasets into informative GIS mapping that will be the first of its kind in Illinois. The end product of the mapping activities will be that of a highly interactive and accessible mapping suite called BroadbandSTAT. This product will allow functional search activities at street levels and will be combined with the U.S. Census and research data to provide users with the ability to drill down to neighborhoods, see which companies provide service in their areas, determine the density of households and populations, and county-level adoption rates. Also of great value will be the collection of datasets reflecting the presence of community anchor institutions throughout the state. Teams are already at work identifying the locations of various health care providers, K-12 schools, public and private colleges and universities, public safety answering points (PSAPs), fire departments, police departments and ambulance services, and, to the extent permissible, other local emergency service agencies. Community Anchor Institution data, including connectivity information will be submitted as datasets to NTIA, but it will also be overlaid within a mapping context to create a remarkable graphic depiction of the locations of these critical connection points form a statewide to local level. Community anchor institutions tend to be key junctures in the development of telecommunication systems, nodes that provide greater access to households and businesses in unserved and underserved areas. Lastly, SBDD funding under this award will provide for five years of planning activities that relate to the consistent and steady communication of the 'messages' of the mapping products throughout the state, including instruction on the use of the mapping tools. Through strategic relationships with various organizations including the Illinois Resource Network, the Governor's Broadband Deployment Council, the Illinois Library Association, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and the Connect Illinois Broadband Resource Development Council, this project envisions a steady flow of communication and information that will ensure full statewide penetration of awareness of the mapping artifacts and how to employ them at their best and highest uses.

The State of Indiana will use the Cooperative Agreement Program (CAP) funding to achieve this goal by fulfilling five objectives: (i) Establish a governance structure that achieves broad-based stakeholder collaboration with transparency, buy-in and trust; (ii) Identify a path to continued sustainability by managing financial resources necessary to fund the State's HIE Strategic Plan and Operational Plan; (iii) Expand the technical infrastructure services that physically enable Health Information Exchange in a secure and appropriate manner; (iv) Expand upon the collaborative efforts between existing HIEs, the state, and regional extension centers to enhance health information exchange capacity within the state and enable meaningful use by providers statewide; and (v) Facilitate adoption of appropriate privacy and security frameworks to expand upon the existing interstate health information exchange. This approach will generate four critical outcomes that ultimately advance the quality of Indiana's health care delivery system: (i) The development of Indiana Health Information Technology, Inc., a state-designated audit, contract, and coordination entity that reflects broad stakeholder representation; (ii) The build-out of required health information exchange capabilities and services as required by CAP; (iii) Continued cultivation of a robust statewide network among the existing regional health information organizations (HIOs); and (iv) the expansion of HIE services to underserved areas. Indiana is fortunate to have five independent, private-sector, regionally-based HIOs, each of which has been operational and sustainable for at least five years. Through these five exchanges, more than 12 million patient records and 12,000 physicians statewide are part of Indiana's HIE networks. Key unifying priorities within the Indiana HIE Program will be a continual emphasis upon HIO board participation/observation, a deep commitment to compliance oversight, and an arms-length grant or contracting relationship with private sector parties. The State of Indiana believes this approach will promote collaboration and innovations among the state's five HIOs and, ultimately, enhance healthcare delivery. At the outset, the Indiana HIE Program will focus upon advancing statewide availability and adoption of exchange services which include: (i) electronic eligibility and claims transactions; (ii) electronic prescribing and refill requests; (iii) electronic laboratory ordering and results delivery; (iv) electronic public health reporting (e.g., immunizations); (v) quality reporting; (vi) prescription fill status and/or medication fill history; and (vii) clinical summary exchange for care coordination and patient engagement. Program success will be measured by the availability and adoption of HIE services statewide by the provider community. The governance, policy, and technical infrastructure of the Indiana HIE Program will adapt as needed to meet any changes to meaningful use requirements, ensuring the continued expansion of secure health information exchanges according to nationally recognized standards. As availability and adoption of these critical services increase, the State of Indiana expects to see significant health care cost savings and improved health outcomes for people in the State of Indiana.

The project consists of five elements: (1) aggressive marketing of the Holy Cross Teacher Education Program (TEP) and the Noyce Scholarship Program to first- and second-year students; (2) new opportunites for first- and second-year STEM majors to serve as paid tutuors and mentors for local inner-city public and private school students learning concepts in mathematics and science; (3) restructuring of the practicum requirement in the Holy Cross TEP to remove scheduling barriers that uniquely affect STEM majors interested in teaching; (4) enhanced support and instruction specific to teaching science and math for STEM majors enrolled in our TEP; and (5) implementation of induction and mentoring activities to support new STEM teachers once they begin their post-graduate teaching responsibilites.  With these program enhancements and the scholarship support provided by the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarshp Program, we will more than double the number of STEM students participating in the TEP over the next five years.  Various components of the project will draw on the strengths provided by STEM education in our liberal arts setting: excellence in the level of research-linked content instruction, an emphasis on active-learining and discovery-based teaching strategies, and opportunities to participate in mentoring relationships.  We will develop a model for how teacher education in STEM disciplines can be enhanced within liberal arts college settings.

This project consists of 5 activities:  1)Ravenswood Facility Construction: The aging Ravenswood Maintenance/Operations facility currently requires numerous improvements in order to continue supporting quality transit services.  These improvements include re-siding of the existing building, re-roofing, resurfacing of a portion of the parking lot, underground storage tank removal and replacement, ADA, generator and fire alarm installation, etc. Additionally, the facility is currently at capacity, making circulation for and storage of additional buses a concern. The lack of additional capacity is especially an issue as it relates to the anticipated arrival of 60 foot articulated buses into our fleet.The maintenance building cannot accommodate 60 foot articulated buses due to its current design and size. With the addition of ARRA funds, Broward County can not only fix the current rehabilitation issues, but meet our needs more long term by making capacity improvements at the site.  2)   Real-time Paratransit Fleet Monitoring: Currently BCT's Paratransit fleet does not operate with some of the technology found on our fixed route buses. The installation of equipment funded by this grant include Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Automatic Vehicle Locators (AVL) and Mobile Data Computers (MDC).  This project activity is intended to improve efficiency and service quality, as well as provide documentation for invoicing and auditing purposes. By having real-time information on individual vehicle locations, management will have specific data as to the operator's ability to meet passenger needs.  3)   Fixed Route Single Log-on Technology: The purpose of this activity is to replace the antiquated login method currently employed on a transit vehicle that requires an Operator to log into each vehicle subsystem (farebox, destination sign, radio enunciator, Automatic Vehicle Locator (AVL) separately. This method is prone to mistakes and can be overwhelming since each system has its own idiosyncrasies regarding data order and formatting. The data collected by these systems is critical in making good decisions related to resources, schedules, and staffing levels. This data is also essential to inform the riders of accurate bus arrival information and to allow them to plan their travel more efficiently and accurately. This activity will identify a single input device that will interact with all critical onboard subsystems to promote the collection of accurate, cohesive data from the disparate systems onboard a transit bus. 4) Bus Stop/Shelter Enhancements: The purpose of this activity is to design, procure, and construct transit shelters to be placed at selected bus stops in Broward County. Sites will be improved to meet all the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements; street furniture, including benches and trash receptacles; bike racks will be added at selected locations; landscaping will be enhanced; and transit signage will be incorporated. Lighting and real-time information will also be incorporated when feasible. The bus stop enhancements will promote transit use for all, including current and potential passengers, by providing waiting area comfort and convenience, a more safe and secure environment, and easily accessible and usable transit information. 5) Operating Assistance: A level of service that was scheduled for significant reduction.  Transit frequencies retained are as follows: 40 minutes for routes 2, 7,10,22,28 on Sundays; 40 minutes for routes 6, 34 and 42 on Saturdays; 30 minutes for routes 2, 7,10,11,22,28,30,31,60,8 on Saturdays; 30 minutes for routes 6,11,28,42, and 55 midday; 40 minutes for routes 20, 62, and 83 midday; 45 minutes for routes 9 and 12 midday; and 30 minutes for routes 16 and 88 for peak midday.

Local eCommunity Strategy teams operate across the state under Connect Ohio's guidance, working to prioritize Broadband initiatives locally. Connected Nation operates in approximately 30 states.  As a part of the local assessment process, community leaders identified Broadband Adoption as a key priority in a majority of the county leadership teams proctored by Connect Ohio. Research indicates that the primary reason for non-adoption in Ohio is lack of value recognition.  In 2009, Connect Ohio developed a project to provide training through libraries and community colleges to 200,000 Ohioans who do not recognize the value of broadband service.  The project partners with approximately 300 local facilities to provide basic computer knowledge and applied internet usage skills with the goal of producing 75,000 new broadband adopters by July, 2012.  As a part of the project, Connect Ohio will direct a statewide Public Awareness Campaign, conveying the value of Broadband service through a variety of media.  The project is funded largely through the ARRA.  Key components of the project include the provision of web-based curriculum, the reimbursement of instructional costs, development of a self-directed training portal, provision of training equipment (computers) to facilities where they are needed, and the development and delivery of a comprehensive statewide public awareness campaign.  The Awareness campaign will reach an estimated 4.2 million households daily with a combination of print, radio, TV, and direct media.   A number of key Community Anchor Institutions are partners in the program.  Over 60 library systems and almost a dozen Community Colleges are providing facilities and instructors to the program.  Together, these partners will deliver more than 80,000 hours of instruction to participants.  Other partners include Broadband Service Providers, media and broadcasting concerns, non-profit technology enablers, and computer equipment and software providers.  The program is projected to create 136 jobs, direct, indirect, and induced.  The majority of these jobs are for instructors across the state, employed or contracted by the Community Anchor partners.  Over 2,000 computers will be deployed directly to training facilities to enable the project.  Many of these computers will also provide enhanced public access capacity for non-program participants both during and after the training period.  Connect Ohio will maintain a Program Office and Field Staff to ensure that the project is coordinated and optimized.  Field Staff will equip, oversee, and review local performance over the 2-year period of the program to ensure optimal results.  24 regions across the state are responsible for reaching their citizenry, training them, and developing new Broadband adopters, under the direction of the Field Staff.  The state is divided into 3 territories, each with a State Operations Manager overseeing the local partners and coordinated by the Program Office, which is responsible for the statewide campaign, and overall goals.  Connect Ohio is responsible for reporting performance to the Department of Commerce, which provides $6.9 million of the projects $10 million budget.    Because of the number of subscribers generated, the program creates a substantial market benefit, approximating $31 million in incremental revenue annually for local businesses.

The network infrastructure will have the capability to conduct large comparative effectiveness research (CER) studies using data collected on patient-reported outcomes collected at the point of care and real-time data collection. Furthermore, we address the important issue of governance to oversee all aspects of managing and conducting research with confidential health information. SPAN will leverage previous AHRQ support of the development of the DEcIDE Distributed Research Network to create the expanded and enhanced network suitable for conducting comparative effectiveness research (CER), compatible with AHRQ?s mission to improve the quality and effectiveness of health care. One particularly unique feature of the SPAN network is the incorporation of integrated  and less-integrated (community) health systems?an addition that poses potential data management challenges that are vastly outweighed by the benefits of adding diverse patient populations to distributed research networks. If this pilot effort on expanding across types of health systems is successful, we would propose future expansion of this feature.

Culture-based methods remain the gold standard for diagnosing drug resistant TB, but M. tuberculosis has a doubling time of 15 - 20 hours, which means that culture-based diagnosis (let alone drug-susceptibility testing) can require several weeks.  The genetics of MDR-TB, however, poses a problem for PCR, molecular beacon, or line-probe tests, because the extent of known drug-resistance signatures greatly exceeds the multiplexing capacity of conventional PCR assays.  At the same time, microarrays are still limited to the research community due to reagent and array expense, large and expensive analysis instruments, and labor and time intensive protocols that typically require an advanced academic degree to operate, use or interpret.  What is therefore needed for MDR-TB diagnostics, especially in low-resource settings, is a highly multiplexed test (e.g. an array) with the sensitivity of PCR, configured as an entirely closed-amplicon test (akin to TaqMan™ PCR), with a technology footprint and price point that moves array-based molecular diagnostics towards low-resource settings where the disease is most prevalent.  Akonni Biosystems has developed a prototype MDR-TB PCR TruArray™ and field-portable, low-cost analysis system to address this need.  The objective of this project is to modestly expand test coverage for MDR- and XDR-TB genotyping, complete the manufacturing scale-up and reagent packaging studies for the resulting kit(s), and perform pre-clinical verification experiments on isolates and amended sputum samples at the Wadsworth Center Laboratory of Clinical Mycobacteriology prior to deployment in regions (U.S. border counties; South Africa) where TB is most prevalent.  Underlying the technical aims is the administrative and management effort associated with developing the tests according to the FDA Quality System Regulation (21 CFR 820).  Successful development and distribution of the MDR-TB array to collaborating, international reference centers will provide the necessary pre-clinical and real-world use data to support distribution of the test kit into global programs in tuberculosis surveillance and control, understand the true frequency of MDR-TB in under-represented populations, and enable prompt treatment of infected individuals with a correct regimen of front-line drugs.","2,985,932",2985932,Diagnostic MDR- and XDR-TB PCR TruArray,"No activity this quarter.

The device meets the goals of the FOA to lower power consumption through reduction of losses, increase the reliability of the Nation?s Grid, and through the demonstration of this device, speed commercial adoption by utility operators. 40% of the total Grid energy losses are from ageing conventional transformers. By using superconducting transformers that are just 0.2% more efficient, Grid energy production could potentially be reduced by one-third, ~ 25TW-hr, resulting in a reduction of over 1.5 x 107 ton of annual CO2 production in the U.S. By integrating fault current limiting capability in the Medium-Power utility transformer, it provides critical downstream protection for existing substation circuit breakers and other devices. This significantly reduces wear and tear on circuit breakers providing lower capital costs, improves power quality for consumers and delivers on the goal for flexibility for new energy technologies that are increasing fault duty problems. Unlike conventional transformers this device can run indefinitely at 100% load without reduction in operating life. This will reduce capital replacement costs and enables the utility to delay capital upgrades for contingency driven expenditures. Beyond the energy savings there are substantial environmental benefits. Conventional transformers are filled with toxic and flammable cooling oil. Approximately one transformer a day catches fire or explodes. The fault current limiting superconducting transformer mitigates both of these risks. Additionally, it occupies approximately 50% of the physical size/weight of a conventional transformer, enabling existing substations to increase their distribution capability without expanding into limited real estate. Finally, this project is well timed. In the U.S. there are approximately 140,000 Medium-Power transformers that are approaching 40 years of service and the end of their life. Within this generation, the vast majority of these conventional transformers will need to be replaced. We have a once in a century opportunity to implement the latest technology that provides energy savings and power quality benefits that directly fulfill the Smart Grid goals established by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.","10,239,411",5476969,Fault Current Limiting Superconducting Transformer,"Q4/2013 activities: Conductor bonding and testing continued to make very good progress in Q4.

An intensive 4-month effort will collect data on service availability by type and technology from each active provider. The initial effort will be sustained via regular communications from the providers throughout the project duration. The project team recognizes that obtaining service provider data may present challenges in terms of data availability, quality, content, and ability of the providers to share data, and have incorporated appropriate contingency plans into the project design. Provider data will be mapped by utilizing street centerline data with their associated address ranges. We will access data from the state?s E-911 program for the towns with coverage, pending signature of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). For the balance of the state, or for the entire state if necessary, we will utilize U.S. Census Bureau TIGER files to provide the required data. The service data in concert with the address range information and other available geospatial data sets will be used to develop state-level broadband availability maps, identifying areas in the state that are well-served by current technologies as well as those that are unserved or underserved. These data will provide an important baseline assessment for New Hampshire, will facilitate effective dialog in the state regarding use and demand for broadband services, and will assist the state as it seeks to prioritize infrastructure projects and to build a sustainable broadband framework for the future. All data collected through the mapping project, and not restricted by a non-disclosure agreement, will be provided to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission to assist in the development and maintenance of the national broadband map. In addition to the mapping and related collaboration, we propose a planning component that will involve the development of broadband stakeholder groups within each region of the State.

MeHI and the Council's efforts build upon Massachusetts's long and successful history of collaboration in using health information technology (HIT) to support health care policy. Various hospitals, health systems and large physician groups in Massachusetts have made considerable progress in deploying EHR systems to office-based providers, placing Massachusetts in a leadership position in HIT. Estimates suggest that in Massachusetts approximately 40% of physicians have EHR systems and 48% of hospitals have Computerized Physician Order Entry systems. As the REC, and given the already extensive dissemination of EHR systems in Massachusetts, MeHI will focus its principal efforts on 2,500 priority providers, as follows: (a) Approximately 1,500 primary care providers in small practices who care for a substantial Medicaid population and who have a significant need for EHR system deployment notwithstanding the progress Massachusetts has otherwise made. For this group, MeHI is working closely with MassHealth (Massachusetts Medicaid) (the Medicaid Director is an ex officio member of the Council) and will work closely with the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers to support medical home initiatives at certain of the Commonwealth's community health centers; (b) Approximately 1,000 primary care providers in small groups who do not yet have access to EHR technology; In addition, the REC will assist other practitioners who may seek its services to facilitate their achieving meaningful use. Under MeHI's business model, MeHI will certify and enter into incentive performance contracts with Implementation Optimization Organizations (IOOs), who in turn will contract with providers to offer a full range of implementation support services with the incented goal of attaining meaningful use. Once implementation is complete, providers will themselves be certified by an independent certification process to attest to their suitability to connect to the HIE and compliance with State law (Chapter 305). Ad Hoc Working Groups, to include industry leaders and appropriate State representatives, will be created to foster public/private collaboration and broaden the range of available expertise for the REC?s efforts, as well as for planning the State-wide HIE. In addition to supporting movement toward meaningful use, MeHI as the REC will also support State policy in areas such as efforts at payment reform currently under active discussion in Massachusetts.","14,507,318",6433318,REGIONAL EXTENSION CENTER FOR COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS,"1.

We also developed Reduced-order models (ROMs) for homes to use thermostat set points and dry bulb temperatures to forecast A/C loads with a high level of accuracy. Using reduced-order models, we investigated the potential of coordinated air conditioning control for a simulated community of 900 homes. The community of homes was created from an extensive data set including home energy audits, homeowner surveys, and meter measurements from actual homes in Austin. We found that rooftop PV tends to align the peak time of all the homes in the community. In the area of PEV, using the charging data from Pecan Street, explanatory variables that characterize the times when people charge their PEVs at home were identified. This same data was used to validate a methodology for predicting the times when PEVs charge based on generic vehicle travel data from the National Household Travel Survey.

In a quest to raise expectations for students regardless of race/ethnicity or income; broaden instruction to include science, social studies, and the arts while exceeding assessment goals; and to save teachers and students valuable instructional time, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) and Pearson, LLC are partnering on a one-of-a-kind, research-based project. MCPS requested $4,999,634 in I3 funds to develop a curriculum and online professional learning community designed to nurture the skills and mindset that will guide Kindergarten?Grade 5 children towards the North Star of college readiness.       The project includes development of a unique college-ready elementary curriculum aligned to the Common Core State Standards.  Integration of content and processes is key to the innovative and time-saving design of this curriculum. A Thinking and Academic Success Skills Framework forms the nucleus around which reading, writing, mathematics, science, social studies, and the arts are carefully planned by marking period.   Identifying and  defining the skills in the framework  that are directly related to skills required for success in advanced level courses will increase the  likelihood that more students will be college-ready while eliminating the disproportionality in college ready graduates by race/ethnicity or income.   The power of making connections among content areas will help unleash the natural curiosity of young children, and the habits that mark the academic mind?persistence, questioning, and collaboration?will be developed beginning in kindergarten. Providing students with explicit instruction in critical and creative thinking skills, and opportunities to develop academic success  skills while learning content, will help students understand how they learn.  Making students aware of how they learn prepares them for lifetime learning.         Pearson, LLC will bring its considerable assets and expertise to help create innovative professional  development and the first generation of post-NCLB assessments that measure achievement of challenging academic standards alongside the thinking and academic success skills that develop advanced learners.  The final design feature of this project will be aligned curriculum and assessments and just-in-time professional development offered in a collaborative Web 2.0 environment.  In a social networking environment, teachers will be able to harness the power of instructional experts and their peers to solve complex and commonplace teaching challenges.        When fully scaled-up, this project will reach 500,000 students and will be standardized for use across the nation.  Project North Star is for all students, and by integrating thinking and academic success skills with all content areas and the arts, sharing teacher-developed lessons and resources, and incorporating the principles of Universal Design for Learning, it will especially be helpful in meeting the needs of students with disabilities and English language learners.

The process converts corn stover or other biomass to a state in which it can be economically handled and stored within the existing agricultural infrastructure.  The converted biomass will be transported to a central facility for further processing into to ethanol and ethyl acrylate.  At the central facility, utilization of the economies of scale will reduce conversion cost making the overall process economically attractive.  The process developed separates the biomass into its three major components, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The hemicellulose and cellulose fractions will be hydrolyzed into sugars, all of the glucose and about 50% of the xylose will be fermented to ethanol. The remaining 50% of the xylose stream will be converted to xylitol and then converted to ethylene glycol propylene glycol and glycerol. The glycerol will be converted to acrylic acid.

In July 2009, the Nevada Governor's Office enlisted Connected Nation, through its subsidiary non-profit Connect Nevada, as the designated entity to undertake a comprehensive broadband data collection and mapping initiative.  Connect Nevada will deliver a comprehensive, granular map and a Census Block level map of existing broadband services.  Connect Nevada, in collaboration with the states broadband providers, will update these maps on a routine basis.  The granular map will be address-searchable, will depict geographical areas, and will present overlaying data relevant to policymakers, providers, and consumers alike.  The Block level map will detail the identification number of each Census Block in Nevada, the total number of households per Block, and the number of households with available broadband service per Block.  Both forms of the map will be accessible to the public via an interactive portal (www.connectnv.org).   This project originally received funding for broadband planning activities and two years of data collection. In September of 2010, the project was amended to extend data collection activities for an additional three years and to identify and implement best practices.  Planning: In July of 2009, the Nevada Broadband Task Force was created and charged with identifying and removing barriers to broadband access, identifying opportunities for increased broadband applications and adoption, and overseeing all necessary duties and responsibilities to reach the goal of expanded broadband technology throughout the state. Connect Nevada will support the Task Force as it carries out its work. As part of its efforts, Connect Nevada will conduct market-based survey research to better understand technology use and barriers to broadband adoption among residents and businesses in Nevada. The outcome of this process will be the development of data-driven analyses of the challenges and opportunities related to broadband deployment and adoption.  State Broadband Capacity Building: Staff time for this project will support the Nevada Broadband Task Force and, at the direction of the Task Force and the State Librarian, coordinate statewide broadband activities and provide outreach to local communities.    Technical Assistance: Through this project, the Connect Nevada initiative will gather and present research to local communities, government and non-profit offices and agencies. In combination with survey work funded in the original proposal, Connect Nevada will have the tools to provide the task force with an analysis of how well the state has met the goals it presented in its broadband strategic plan.    Local Regional Technology Planning Teams: This project will support regional planning teams in the 14 counties with the lowest rates of broadband availability and adoption. Planning Teams will meet at local libraries and will be composed of volunteers representing a cross-section of the community. The local planning process will work in parallel with and compliment the work of the BTOP-funded One Click Away project, which will provide technical training to local residents.

In August 2009, the Iowa Utilities Board launched the Connected Iowa initiative to lay the groundwork for increased broadband in underserved areas.  A key component of the Connect Iowa initiative is the mapping the current broadband availability throughout the state. Connect Iowa, by employing industry-standard Geographic Information Systems (GIS) toolsets and experienced personnel, is delivering a comprehensive, granular map of existing broadband service. Connect Iowa, in conjunction with broadband providers, will update these maps on a routine basis to reflect real-time broadband availability. Maps will be accessible to the general public via an interactive portal located at www.connectiowa.org.  The interactive portal will present overlaying data relevant to policymakers, providers, and consumers alike, including household density and other demographic information, topographical information, and civil infrastructure data.

The proposed work by the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA) will continue and expand the investigation of seasonal-to-interannual predictability in a changing climate, focusing on realizable predictability of the current climate, including the influence of global change - changing greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosols and land use - on the interactive ocean-atmosphere-land-cryosphere system. A comprehensive predictability framework, grounded in information theory, will be further developed to understand the contributions to predictability from the initial state, the high and low frequency atmospheric transients, the coupling of climate system components, and global change. The role of the land surface and its couplings to the atmosphere and oceans, the predictability of El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the ENSO response, intrinsic vs. externally-forced variations in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, the global hydrologic cycle, monsoons and North American drought, and the predictability of the statistics of weather and climate extremes will be specifically addressed.  The scope of work will be extended to investigate the predictability of decadal variations to determine (1) whether or not shifts in the probability distribution of ENSO, or of seasonal anomalies in general, are predictable at decadal lead times, (2) the limits of decadal predictability, and (3) the effects of global change. The question of how the predictability of the natural modes of variability may change in conjunction with the global change is particularly relevant for providing regionally specific information on future climate and depends critically on the simulation capabilities of climate models. The long-term goal will be to help establish the scientific foundations for dynamic decadal climate prediction. This work will employ the national climate models supported by NSF, NOAA, and NASA, including the CCSM, CFS, GEOS and GFDL models, with efforts to identify the strengths and weaknesses of individual models and to optimally combine them (both a priori and a posteriori). The prospect of much higher resolutions in these global models is of critical importance. The proposed work will also include initial efforts directed toward process-resolving models for climate prediction in collaboration with CMMAP, both for the purposes of predictability/prediction studies and to evaluate the efficacy of resolved vs. parameterized clouds in global climate models. The ways in which model deficiencies are limiting the ability to both quantify predictability and realize skillful climate predictions will be examined. Maximum advantage will be taken of each model’s individual strengths and uniqueness, including its niche in the nation’s climate modeling agenda, and feedback at scientific and operational levels will be provided to each of the modeling groups.While COLA’s primary focus is basic research, its establishment as a national center, its strategic partnerships and its open policies make COLA a national resource. The Committee on Strategic Guidance for NSF’s Support of the Atmospheric Sciences (2007) found that COLA’s efforts to understand climate predictability, to provide national leadership in climate research, and to provide information technology infrastructure are important contributors to the nation’s multi-agency goals for global climate variability and change and better climate forecast services.

This vision drives synergies throughout the scope of the project, benefiting customers, providing efficient utility operations, and providing societal benefits for the general community at large.   Environmentally the deferrals of peak generation capacity; decreased energy usage, improved system line losses, and reduction of vehicle emissions used for monthly meter reading reduce the carbon gas footprint by 14,742 tons of CO2 annually.     The Smart Grid initiative will integrate the core of the project, Advance Metering Infrastructure (AMI) over a two and one half year implementation schedule, to achieve synergies with Outage Management capability and Distribution Automation.  Efficiencies in Outage Management include shorter reaction time in identifying distribution system incidents, less miss-direction of mobile resources in rectifying outage cases, and improved interruption indexes.    Although Lakeland Electric today operates a distribution automation system, the Smart Grid initiative allows the further automation / optimization of the distribution system.  The economics of AMI metering devices enables the less expensive means to monitor the microgrid.  Load monitoring of distribution feeders, capacitor banks, and critical switch locations will be done on a larger scale system wide.  This capability furthers the self-healing development of the smart gird function.

We suggested that a platform with “substitutable” apps constructed around core services is a promising approach to driving down HIT costs and supporting standards evolution. We propose the SMArt (Substitutable Medical Apps, reusable technologies) platform architecture, with two major goals. The first is a user-facing component architecture that allows “iPhone-like” substitutability for medical apps based on scalable core service building blocks. The second is a set of network services for medical data and transactions, scalable to the national level but nonetheless respecting institutional autonomy and patient privacy. These two goals subsume four projects. PROJECT 1 focuses on the networked services that are required for the SMArt platform and how they scale from the practice to the nation. PROJECT 2 is an investigation of the SMArt platform architecture including testing a small number of apps such as medication management transactions across many of the stakeholders. PROJECT 3 investigates how to retrofit existing commercial and non-profit, open source health IT platforms so that SMArt apps can be substituted on all of them, as needed. PROJECT 4 lays down the sustainable infrastructure for a SMArt ecosystem whereby apps and platforms can be rapidly tested, shared, and substituted in a SMArt exchange. This will provide for an agile substrate for national experiments of different approaches to meaningful use. We have formed strong, strategic relationships with industrial partners such as Microsoft, CVS/Caremark, SureScripts, Cerner and Athena Health, to enable timely and impactful transition to real world practice through cross-platform compatibility of extant open source and proprietary systems with the SMArt platform. Anticipated outcomes are foundational knowledge and useable, testable prototypes for a national-scale SMArt platform with a burgeoning ecosystem, robust and scalable network data services, and advanced data analytics.","15,000,000",8559910,Innovation Platform for Substitutable Apps with Access to Networked Healthcare Data,"The Substitutable Medical Apps Reusable Technologies project has continued to make progress towards our Project 1, 2, 3, and 4 goals as the project completes its second-to-last quarter.

Recognizing that connectivity challenges still exist, especially for rural residents, Alaska has embarked on an important initiative to expand broadband access to areas where it does not exist and enhance the quality of service in areas that are already served. The first step in laying the groundwork for such an initiative is to produce an accurate, granular broadband availability map that will identify both unserved and underserved areas.  The Connect Alaska initiative will create a comprehensive broadband map for Alaska and providing data on broadband availability, technology, speed, and infrastructure. The map will be used to help develop the infrastructure necessary to allow high-speed Internet companies to increase their service capacity to consumers across Alaska. In June 2010, The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) provided grant funds to Connected Nation, as the designated entity in coordinating broadband expansion activities in Alaska, to implement this project. The initiative will be conducted through the non-profit subsidiary of Connected Nation, Connect Alaska, created by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.   Working with the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community & Economic Development (DCCED), Connect Alaska, by employing industry-standard Geographic Information System toolsets and experience, is delivering a comprehensive, granular map of existing broadband service. Connect Alaska, in collaboration with broadband providers, will update these maps on a routine basis to reflect real-time broadband availability. Maps will be accessible to the general public via an interactive portal located at www.connectak.org. The interactive portal will also present overlaying data relevant to policymakers, providers, and consumers alike, including household density and other demographic information, topographical information, and civil infrastructure data. The map will be address-searchable and will depict geographical areas such as municipalities, cities, townships, political districts, and state and federal lands. Connect Alaska will also release and maintain a Census Block level map of available broadband service in the state.  This project was originally funded for broadband planning activities and two years of data collection. In September of 2010, this project was amended to extend data collection activities for an additional three years and to identify and implement best practices.  State Broadband Capacity Building: This project will provide support to the Alaska Broadband Task Force as it seeks to both formalize a strategic broadband plan for the state of Alaska and coordinate broadband activities across relevant agencies and organizations.   Technical Assistance: This project will undertake research and benchmarking activities on broadband needs, usage, and barriers in local communities and also measure the impact of broadband implementation over time. Connected Nation will also provide training to the Alaska Regional Development Organizations (ARDORs) as they incorporate broadband planning into their ongoing responsibilities.  Application Usage and Development: This project will conduct an assessment on the availability and quality of e-government applications. The final report will identify deficiencies and opportunities for improvement, particularly among remote and rural populations. The Alaska Broadband Task Force will use these findings to determine how to fund innovative e-government and web 2.0 applications via a sub-grant process that will make government services and data more readily available to communities in Alaska.","6,378,198",5789137,"American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-SBI-Connected Nation, Inc.-Alaska","The Alaska broadband maps were updated with data from the semi-annual mapping data submission to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

In response, there is increasing use of automated sensors to collect environmental data creating a new need for training of environmental scientists. Training doctoral students in materials science, aquatic science, environmental sensors and business is thus the primary goal of this project. The curriculum emphasizes concentrated courses coupled with hands-on experiences to accomplish the main educational goals: environmental research education based on hypothesis testing and exposure of students to sensor development and business principles. To foster community development, cohorts will participate in multi-disciplinary workgroups. The training provided by this project will prepare graduate students for a variety of future careers relevant to freshwater resources. Results of the research will be disseminated to stimulate K-16 and public interest in environmental science. Development of a diverse research community will be facilitated via a combination of recruitment and ongoing program connections. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.
